<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN MAKES HIS DEBÛT.
</h3>

<p>
"It may be old-fashioned to drive a coach to the
Derby, but I'll be in my coffin before I'll go down
any other way!"  Thus, perpetrating a characteristic
"bull," spoke genial and popular "Old
Rory," as he was known to the best part of the
world&mdash;Sir Roderick Macphane, to give him his
true title.
</p>

<p>
A few minutes back he had handed over the
ribbons to one of the grooms, who, with his fellow,
was now busily engaged unharnessing the horses,
four fine roans, as handsome a team as the heart
of man could desire.  "Old Rory" was a famous
whip, and, in spite of his advancing years, a good
all-round sportsman&mdash;a master of hounds, a familiar
figure on the race-course, and as good a judge of
horse and dog flesh as any in the country.  In his
younger days he had been an intrepid rider at the
hurdles, an amateur of more than common merit.
</p>

<p>
There was, perhaps, no more popular man than
"Rory" Macphane in the three kingdoms.  He
was laughed at, especially in Parliament, where he
held a seat for an Irish division, because of his
quaint sayings and frequent <i>faux pas</i>, but his good
nature, charity, and kindness of heart were admitted
on all sides.  They were as palpable as his
sportsmanship.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn Clithero, who occupied a seat at the
back of the coach together with his friend and
future brother-in-law, Pierce Trelawny, a nephew
of Sir Roderick's, enjoyed the comments of the
crowd as the coach threaded its way to the
appointed place opposite the Grand Stand.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'Old Rory,' what owns Hipponous."  How
the populace murdered the colt's name!
"The Derby winner&mdash;perhaps!  He's one of the
best.  Look at the old sport sitting up there with
his back as straight as a lad's!  Good luck to ye,
sir, and good luck to the 'oss!  Hip&mdash;Hip&mdash;Hipponous!"  This
had become a popular catch-word,
easily taken up and repeated.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick smiled a little and nodded now and
again, quite conscious of his popularity and of that
of his horse.  It was the ambition of his life to
win the Derby.  He had tried many times and
failed, but on the present occasion it looked as if
he stood a good chance, for Hipponous had won
the Middle Park Plate and was second favourite in
the betting.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick stood up on the box, his back
turned to the course, and made a little speech to
his guests.  Lady Lempiere, who had occupied
the place of honour by his side, and to whom his
first remark had been addressed, turned too, as in
duty bound.  She was a well-known society dame,
no longer young but still reputed for her beauty
as well as for her success upon the turf.  She fixed
her eyes, which were blue and liquid and full of
expression, upon Major Molyneux, who sat directly
behind her, and who&mdash;or so her eyes seemed to
say&mdash;might soon be by her side.  He was her
accepted cavalier, and it was an understood thing
that wherever Lady Lempiere was asked Major
Molyneux must also receive his invitation.
</p>

<p>
"I want you all to understand that ceremony
is a non-starter to-day," thus spoke Sir Roderick,
"and this is to be a go-as-you-please race for all
of you.  There's lunch on the coach for any one
at any time it's asked for, and the ice will give out
before the wine does, though we've got a hundredweight
on board.  Bring as many of your friends
as you like; there's enough for all.  Don't worry
about me: I shall probably be in the House&mdash;I mean
the Paddock"&mdash;he corrected himself with a broad
smile&mdash;"a place where I'm more in my element,
and occasionally get listened to."  He drew a deep
breath as of relief at a duty performed.  "Since
I'm not at Westminster," he added, "I needn't
talk for an hour when all I have to say is just
comprised in two words: good luck!"
</p>

<p>
The little speech was greeted with laughter and
applause, applause in which none was so vociferous
as an individual with a bibulous red face and
a white beard, who had the carefully fostered
appearance of a military man.  This was Captain
Armitage, and he occupied the back seat together
with Mostyn Clithero, Pierce Trelawny, and a fourth
man, Anthony Royce by name, who from his
manner rather than his speech gave the impression
of being an American.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder," whispered Mostyn to his friend,
"what makes the captain so particularly
demonstrative?"
</p>

<p>
"The idea that he'll soon get a drink, I expect,"
was the answer, spoken in an undertone, although
Captain Armitage had turned his back and was
airily waving his hand to his daughter, Rada, who
sat on the front seat, pretending to listen with
interest to the conversational inanities of young
Lord Caldershot.
</p>

<p>
"I guess you're right there," commented Mr. Royce,
his sides shaking with silent laughter.  He
had a way of laughing inwardly and without any
apparent reason that was rather disconcerting till
one was accustomed to it; it gave the impression
that he was possessed of a peculiarly selfish sense
of humour.  He was an Englishman by birth,
though for the last twenty years he had made his
home in the States, where he had accumulated
a great fortune and had become a recognised power
in Wall Street.  He had also gained some reputation
as a traveller&mdash;an explorer upon scientific lines of
little-known parts of the world&mdash;and he had but
recently returned from an expedition of the sort,
an expedition organised and financed by himself,
which had, however, only partially achieved its
object.
</p>

<p>
"Armitage will punish the champagne before
the day's through," he continued in a voice that
was agreeably free from nasal twang.  "Look at
him now!"  Captain Armitage had swung himself
down from the coach and could be seen in interested
converse with the butler, who had emerged from
its interior.  "He's a curious sort of fellow, is the
captain.  Had a big fortune once, but did it all
in on the turf.  Kind-hearted fellows like Rory
still keep in with him for the sake of old times, and
because of the girl, who's a character, too, in her
way.  They live in a tumble-down cottage near
John Treves's training stables at Partinborough, in
Cambridgeshire.  It was there I first came across
them, for I've a house of my own in the neighbourhood.
The girl"&mdash;he nodded his head in the
direction of Rada&mdash;"has a poor time of it, and
just runs wild.  Armitage brings her to London
now and then and tries to make a dash, showing up
at the big race meetings and putting on a swagger,
although heaven alone knows in what wretched
lodgings he hangs out!  He spends most of the
time at his club, and leaves Rada to look after
herself.  He manages somehow to keep a horse or two
in training at Treves's, but he's a sponge, and that's
why I warn you two young fellows about him."
</p>

<p>
It was very clear that Anthony Royce had no
liking for the bibulous captain: nor had Mostyn
Clithero, even upon his shorter acquaintance, and
that with good reason.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn knew nothing about racing; he was a very
innocent in all matters connected with the turf.
Captain Armitage had made this discovery very
early in the day&mdash;when the party had met at Sir
Roderick's house in Eaton Square, in fact&mdash;and
he had proceeded to amuse himself at the young
man's expense, a fact of which Mostyn had
subsequently become uneasily aware.  There was one
matter especially which weighed upon his mind,
and now, feeling himself with friends, he proceeded
to unburden himself.
</p>

<p>
"I think," he said, "that Captain Armitage
has been making fun of me.  Is it true that
Hipponous won the Waterloo Cup?"
</p>

<p>
There remained no doubt in Mostyn's mind after
he had put that question, though his two
companions let him down as gently as they could;
even, as far as possible, refraining from laughter as
they gave the necessary explanation.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn flushed indignantly.  "It was too bad
of him," he cried; "too bad.  He came up and
talked so amiably that I quite believed all he said.
Of course, he saw at once that I was a fool.  He
asked me if I could remember what price Hipponous
had started at for the Waterloo Cup.  And later"&mdash;his
voice trembled&mdash;"I asked other people if they
could tell me.  I asked Lord Caldershot, and he
just stared at me through that beastly eye-glass
of his and turned away.  And then I asked Miss
Armitage, to whom I had just been introduced.
I couldn't make out why she laughed at me.  I was
a fool to come to the races at all!" he ended,
miserably.
</p>

<p>
He had come full of enthusiasm, and at a
personal risk of which none but he himself knew
the full measure, so his sense of wrong was all the
more acute.  Nor was he easily appeased, though
both Pierce Trelawny and Anthony Royce did their
best to make light of the incident.
</p>

<p>
"It was too bad of Armitage to pull your leg,"
Royce said feelingly.  "I'll have a word with him
on the subject.  But in the meanwhile forget all
about it, my boy, and enjoy your day."
</p>

<p>
Anthony Royce had shown himself very well
disposed towards Mostyn on the way down, fully
appreciative of the young man's enthusiasm as
well as his ignorance, and it was due to him that
Captain Armitage, who had evinced an inclination
to continue the "leg-pulling" sport, had been
finally silenced.
</p>

<p>
It was by Royce's own wish that he had taken a
seat at the back of the coach, giving up his place
in the front to the fair-haired youth, Lord Caldershot,
gorgeous with eye-glass and button-hole, who
had immediately appropriated Rada Armitage as
his particular property for the day.  They had
already established themselves in the front when
Mostyn clambered up at the back, and they were
laughing together, their eyes turned upon him.  He
was sure, even then, that he was the object of their
laughter.  He had taken a dislike to the girl, though
he could have given no reason for the feeling.
</p>

<p>
For he had recognised&mdash;he could not fail to
recognise&mdash;that Rada was young&mdash;she could not
have been much over twenty&mdash;high-spirited, and
good to look at.  Unfortunately he was always
a little diffident and shy with strange girls&mdash;qualities
that were not really natural to him, but which
were the result of his home training&mdash;and he had
not shown himself at his best that morning.  Of
course, matters had not been improved when she
laughed at him, apparently without cause.  When
he mounted the coach his one wish was that the
Armitages had been left out of the party altogether.
He was struck by the contrast between Royce
and the captain.  The former was evidently strong
and masterful, possessed of a will of iron, while
the latter was bombastic, given to swagger, and
totally lacking in repose.  He was never still for
a moment: he would shuffle his feet and fidget with
his hands; he would spring up from his seat and
then immediately sit down again; he would wave
his arms and strike attitudes.  His voice was now
raised to a shout, now lowered to a whisper, hardly
ever even in tone.  Sometimes he would break
out into snatches of song, particularly aggravating,
since it usually occurred when he was being
addressed.  He was one of those men who seldom,
even early in the morning, appear quite sober.
</p>

<p>
While on the road Armitage would have
continued to make fun of Mostyn, an easy victim,
had not Royce quietly intervened.  The big
financier had taken a fancy to the boy, and did not
intend to see him bullied.
</p>

<p>
It was unfair, and particularly so because Mostyn
had admitted from the first, and with becoming
modesty, that he was totally lacking in racing
experience.  Yet he was obviously enthusiastic,
and Anthony Royce, man of the world, admired
the enthusiasm of the tall fair boy who was so
simple and yet so manly withal.  There was
something about Mostyn's eyes, too; but upon this
point the American was not yet sure of his ground.
Mostyn Clithero was risking much that day.
This jaunt to the Derby was a stolen expedition,
undertaken without the knowledge of his father,
and Mostyn knew quite well that when the truth
came out there would be a terrible scene.
</p>

<p>
John Clithero looked upon the race-course as the
devil's playground, and racing men as the devil's
disciples; furthermore, he had sternly imposed this
faith upon his children.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had never accepted his father's views,
though he did not dispute them.  He liked horses
without understanding them, and he had a good
seat in the saddle, though his opportunities for
riding were few and far between.  It was natural
that he should have a more open mind than either
of his two elder brothers, James and Charles, for
they had been brought up at home under their
father's influence, while Mostyn had enjoyed an
Eton and Oxford education, this being due to the
intervention of his mother, now dead, who had
probably vaguely realised that her elder sons were
developing into prigs.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, however, so far had respected his father's
prejudices.  He had never risked a penny in
gambling of any sort; he had refused all invitations
to attend race meetings; he had even avoided the
theatre, this because he felt it his duty as his
father's son.  It was not an easy task for him,
for his instincts were all towards the natural
enjoyment of life: he was just a healthy-minded,
well-intentioned young Englishman with nothing of the
prig about him.  Luckily for himself he developed
a taste for athletics, and so by his prowess on the
river and in the football field he gained respect
both at school and University, and his prejudices
were overlooked or readily forgiven.  Mostyn never
confided to anyone, till Pierce came upon the
scene, how irksome these restraints were to him,
how his inmost soul militated against them.
</p>

<p>
It was after he came down from Oxford and set
to work to study for the Bar that he met Pierce
Trelawny.  Pierce was already engaged to Cicely,
Mostyn's sister, though the match had not met with
the unqualified approval of John Clithero, who
considered the young man worldly-minded and fast
because he went to theatres and attended
race-meetings; and besides, the whole Trelawny family
were conspicuously sporting.  On the other hand,
there was no question as to the desirability of the
engagement from the social and monetary point of
view, and it was to these considerations that Cicely's
father had yielded, seeing nothing unreasonable in
this shelving of his principles in favour of Mammon.
As for Pierce, he was in love with Cicely, whose
nature was akin to that of her brother Mostyn;
and he did not worry his head about the rest of
her family, whom he placidly despised, until he
discovered that Mostyn was fashioned in a different
mould.  After that the two young men became
firm friends, and went about a good deal together,
though John Clithero looked on askance, believing
that his son was being led astray; indeed, there
had been one or two rather stormy scenes, for
a new spirit had been aroused in Mostyn's breast,
a desire to unfurl the standard of revolt.
</p>

<p>
Then came the great temptation.  Pierce
Trelawny had received an invitation to drive down
to the Derby on his uncle's coach, and had been
told that he might take a friend with him.  "Why
not bring your future brother-in-law?" Sir
Roderick suggested.  "I mean the lad you introduced
to me in the Park the other day.  Rowed for his
college, didn't he?  Was in the Eton eight, and
did well at racquets?  That's the sort of boy I
like&mdash;a young sportsman."
</p>

<p>
"God bless my soul!" the old gentleman cried,
when Pierce explained that Mostyn had never seen
a race, and the reason for this neglect.  "I did not
know that any sensible people held such views
nowadays.  They even wanted to keep us at
work at Westminster on Derby day," he added,
with apparent inconsistency, "but I don't look
for sense in the House of Commons!  That's why
I went into Parliament."  He meant, of course,
that it was his object to convince his fellow-members
of their folly.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick was returned for one of the divisions
of Ulster, and had held his seat, undisputed, for
many years.  He was a Tory of the old school,
staunchly loyal, and to his mind no other views
were admissible.  Politics, therefore, in the sense
of party division, did not exist.  He loathed the
very word.  He would say irritably, "Don't talk
to me of politics, I hate 'em&mdash;and, besides, there's
no such thing."  His Irishisms and unconscious
word contortions contributed to the amusement of
the House as well as to his personal popularity.
</p>

<p>
"Bring young Clithero, Pierce," he said decidedly.
"It'll do him good, open his eyes a bit.  He's too
fine a lad to have his head stuffed with such
nonsensical ideas.  How old is he, did you say?
Twenty-five?  Well, he's quite old enough to have
a will of his own."  All of which was perfectly
true, but Sir Roderick, as well as Pierce,
overlooked the fact that Mostyn was utterly dependent
upon his father.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, John Clithero was absent from
London when Pierce conveyed Sir Roderick's
invitation to Mostyn, and so he could not be
consulted: the hopeless task of asking his approval
could not be undertaken.  It was open to Mostyn
to keep his own counsel: to go to the Derby on
the sly&mdash;a course that did not commend itself to
his straightforward nature&mdash;or to make confession
when his father returned, which would be two or
three days after the Derby had been run.
Letter-writing was out of the question, too, for John
Clithero was actually on his way home from America,
where he had been upon business.  He was
a banker, head of the old established house of
Graves and Clithero, a firm of the highest repute
and universally considered as stable as the Bank
of England, all the more so because of the high
standard of morality demanded of all connected
with it, from the partners to the humblest employee.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn did not hesitate long.  He wanted to see
the Derby, and he was asked to go as the guest of
a man who was universally respected.  Only rank
prejudice could assert harm in this.  It was time
to make his protest.  And so, the evening before
the race, he quietly announced his intention to his
horrified brothers.
</p>

<p>
"A beastly race-course," sniffed James.  "All
the riff-raff of London.  An encouragement to
gambling, drunkenness, and vice."  James was
a perfect type of the "good young man"; than
that no more need be said.
</p>

<p>
"Just because father happens to be away,"
remarked Charles; "I suppose that's your idea of
honour, Mostyn."  Charles was always talking about
honour.  He was unhealthily stout, had pasty
cheeks and long yellow hair that lacked vitality.
</p>

<p>
"I think Mostyn's quite right, and I wish I was
going too," proclaimed Cicely the rebellious.
</p>

<p>
And so the wrangle proceeded.  It was
distinctly uncomfortable, but Mostyn was quite
determined to abide by his decision.  Nor had he
changed his mind when the next day came.
</p>

<p>
Owing to the behaviour of Captain Armitage it
had not at first been particularly pleasant for
Mostyn upon the coach, but Pierce and Mr. Royce
had come to the rescue, the former engaging the
attention of the captain, while the latter took the
boy in hand and explained certain things that he
ought to know about racing.  It was all done
with such infinite tact that Mostyn was soon at his
ease, able to enjoy the fund of anecdote with which
Anthony Royce enlivened the journey, as well as
the scenes by the way, the ever-changing panorama,
of which he had read, but which he had never
expected to see.
</p>

<p>
He spoke little, but his eyes glittered with
excitement.  To him it was as though he was being
carried into a new world, a world with which his
soul was in sympathy, but the gates of which had
always been closed.  And yet it was not so strange
to him as he had expected: perhaps in his dreams
he had gazed through the gates, or even travelled
down that very road upon a visionary coach that
threaded its way proudly amid the heterogeneous
traffic.  So, despite his ignorance and inexperience,
he felt in his element; he was a sportsman by
instinct, so he told himself, and all these years he
had been crushing down his true nature.  Well, it
was not too late to repair the mischief: for now he
knew&mdash;he knew.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Royce watched him with kindly appreciative
eyes.  There were moments, though Mostyn
was far too absorbed to notice this, when his broad
forehead wrinkled into a frown as he gazed into
the young man's face; it was a peculiar enigmatical
frown, suggestive of an effort to think back into
the past, to pierce the veil of years.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn could hold himself in no longer when
the coach had taken up its place under the hill,
and when Sir Roderick, by his little speech, had
discharged his obligation towards his guests.  A few
moments of bustle followed.  Captain Armitage,
champagne bottle in hand, was filling a glass for
Lord Caldershot, who was stooping down from his
place upon the coach to take it; Rada was intently
studying a race-card and comparing it with a little
pink paper&mdash;a paper issued by some tipster or
other; most of the other guests had already
descended and mingled with the crowd.  Among
these was Pierce, who had hurried off after his
uncle in the direction of the Paddock.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn stood up in his place; he was quivering
with excitement, all his nerves seemed on edge.
He stared about him and took in at a glance the
whole wonderful sight&mdash;the restless mass of
humanity seething over hill and dale, humanity in
all its gradations, from the coster and his lass to
the top-hatted men and smartly-dressed women
who mingled with the throng till they found their
centre in the enclosure and Grand Stand.  The
highest in all the land and the lowest&mdash;silk, satin,
muslin, rags&mdash;Mayfair and Whitechapel&mdash;Tom,
Dick, Harry, as alive and playful to-day as in the
forties&mdash;they were all there just as Mostyn had
read of them many a time.  The white tents, the
extravagantly dressed bookmakers, the itinerant
musicians and jugglers, the gipsies.  He drew a deep
breath; he was looking upon the world!
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad I came," he cried, forgetting for the
moment that he was not alone.  "For now I know
what it is to be alive."
</p>

<p>
His voice shook.  Anthony Royce laid his hand
gently upon the boy's shoulder.  "I like your
enthusiasm," he said, "I understand it.  You are
just making your debût upon a larger stage, and it
is a little overwhelming.  Well, I'll put you through
your paces, my boy.  Leave yourself in my hands
and you won't regret it.  I'll guarantee that your
first Derby Day shall not be your last."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn accepted joyfully.  "You're awfully kind,
sir," he said.  "I'm afraid I should have a poor
time by myself, and I don't like to bother
Pierce&mdash;besides, he wants to be with Sir Roderick.  It's
good of you to pity my ignorance.  I wonder why
you do it?"
</p>

<p>
Royce made no reply&mdash;probably none was expected.
Only that strange enigmatical smile came
once more to his face, and for a moment his eyes were
vacant&mdash;again it was as though he were looking back
into the past.
</p>

<p>
To himself Mostyn muttered: "Sufficient unto
the day is the evil thereof."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN SEES THE DERBY.
</h3>

<p>
An hour before the big race Mostyn stood in the
Paddock, by the side of his mentor, and pretended
to pass a critical eye upon the horses generally, and
upon Hipponous in particular.
</p>

<p>
The second favourite was a chestnut with three
white stockings.  His mane had been hogged, and
he had&mdash;for a racehorse&mdash;an unusually large tail.
Tyro as he was, Mostyn could understand the value
of the large roomy flanks and magnificent barrel,
and as the colt picked its way delicately round the
circle, sweating slightly from excitement and glancing
intelligently from side to side, it seemed as if he
appreciated the fact that it was Derby Day, and
realised the magnitude of the task before him.
</p>

<p>
A kaleidoscopic crowd surged round the horse,
a crowd that Mostyn failed to understand till Royce
explained that the "open sesame" to the Paddock
could be obtained by the payment of a sovereign,
which accounted for the general rubbing of shoulders
and absence of class distinction.
</p>

<p>
Scraps of conversation, indistinctly overheard,
amused, astonished, and perhaps instructed, him.
There was a portly woman with a red face and a
large feather hat, who pushed her way to the front,
and said wheezingly to a thin little man at her side:
"'Ullo, 'ere's Black Diamond."
</p>

<p>
"No, it ain't," responded her companion.  "Look
at the number.  That's 'Ippernouse.  He won
the Middle Park Plate when I 'ad a dollar on
'im, and I'm going to put a couple o' quid on 'im
to-day."
</p>

<p>
"I'll back Black Diamond," returned the fat
woman, "because my first husband kept a small
public called the 'Lord Napier' up past the 'Nag's
Head' before we were married, and Black Diamond
belongs to Lord Napier, so that's good enough for
my money."
</p>

<p>
They drifted away and their place was taken by
a couple of shrewd-looking club-men in long covert
cloaks and bowler hats, with glasses slung over
their shoulders.  Mostyn heard one of them say to
the other in an undertone: "Here's Hipponous.
Look at his magnificent quarters.  Don't forget
to wire off immediately to Cork if he wins,
and tell Dickson that I'll take the colt he has
in his stables, brother to Hipponous, and if he
throws the mare in I'll pay two thousand guineas
for the pair."
</p>

<p>
This was business, and presently Mostyn heard
business of another kind.  "I like the looks of
'Ippernous," said a loudly dressed individual with
white hat and check waistcoat&mdash;obviously a
book-maker&mdash;to his clerk.  "We can't afford to let him
run loose, and I'll put fifty on for the book."
</p>

<p>
The remarks, however, were not all appreciative.
There was a tall man with a vacant stare and a
monocle, who was drawling out his comments to
a well-dressed woman at his side.  "Not an
earthly, my dear.  Don't waste your money on
Hipponous.  The favourite can't possibly lose.
Algy told me at the club last night that he had
laid six monkeys to four on it, and if it doesn't
come off he'll have to tap the old man again or
send in his papers."
</p>

<p>
Then again: "What on earth do they call this
horse Hipponous for?" queried a pretty little
soubrette, hanging on the arm of a young gentleman in
a very long frock coat, suggestive of the counter.
"Don't know, Ellice," was the reply, "but give
me Lochiel, the fav'rit."  "Oh, no," she urged,
"do back Hipponous!  He's got such pretty
colours&mdash;scarlet and silver&mdash;just like that dress
I had last Christmas for the Licensed Victuallers'
Ball."
</p>

<p>
Finally, there was the comment facetious:
"'Ippernous," said a seedy-looking man with pasty
face to the lad who was leading the colt round,
"W'y didn't they call 'im 'Ipperpotamus, an' a'
done with it?  A fine lookin' colt, mind yer, but
not quite good enough to beat the fav'rit, 'oo will
'ave the satisfaction of carryin' a couple of Oxfords
for Jim Simson of Kemberwell."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had but a dim understanding of all this,
but his heart leapt within him when Pierce came up,
and smiting him cordially on the back, carried him off
to wish good luck to Sir Roderick, who was standing
by the side of his horse in the company of Joseph
Dean, the famous trainer, and of Fred Martin, the
jockey, who held the record of winning mounts for
the year before.  Martin wore Sir Roderick's
colours&mdash;silver and scarlet&mdash;and his little twinkling eyes
glittered as he confided to Mostyn that he was
proud to wear them, and that he had every
confidence in his horse&mdash;that he hoped to score his
fifth Derby success.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn felt in the seventh heaven, a privileged
being, all the more so since envious eyes were
upon him.  It was all he could do to hold himself
with becoming gravity.  His great desire was to
pose as a man of experience, but, at the same
time, there were so many questions he wished to
ask.  And at last his evil genius impelled him
to an ineptitude, one of those blunders that
seemed to come so easily to his tongue: he
wanted to know Hipponous's age!  Something
in the jockey's stare as he made answer warned
Mostyn of danger, and he moved away as soon
as he dared.
</p>

<p>
"That's 'Ipponous, ain't it?"  An ungrammatical
stranger, who, in spite of his horsey
attire, was evidently but poorly informed, pushed
his way to Mostyn's side.  "A fine horse&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
"I should think so," responded the young man
heartily.  "An Irish horse; comes from Sir
Roderick Macphane's stables in Ulster.  Trained
by Joseph Dean here at Epsom."  Mostyn felt on
safe ground in giving this information.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  The stranger leered out of the corner
of his eye.  "I dessay you know a bit, what?
I see you talking to Martin just now.  What does
Martin think of his mount?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, he says"&mdash;Mostyn got no further, for
luckily at that moment Anthony Royce appeared,
and, laying his hand upon his young friend's arm
gently led him away, very much to the annoyance
of the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Be careful of affable folk who try to get into
conversation with you on the race-course," was all
the reproach that Royce uttered; but Mostyn felt
that he had been about to blunder, and once more
anathematised himself for a fool.
</p>

<p>
The American did not lose sight of his young
<i>protégé</i> again after that, but devoted himself to
his work of instruction.  Mostyn absorbed knowledge
eagerly.  "I asked Martin how old his horse
was," he was constrained to admit.
</p>

<p>
Royce's sides shook with silent laughter.
"Never mind," he said.  "You'll know better
next time."  Then he went on to explain about
betting, and how easily the market may be affected.
"If you want to have a bet," he added, "I'll
introduce you in the right quarter.  You can't do
better than back Hipponous to win and a place.
He'll start at four to one.  I don't believe in the
favourite, though it's money on."
</p>

<p>
But Mostyn shook his head.  "I don't want to
bet," he said.  "Gambling doesn't attract me a bit.
It's just the sport of the thing."
</p>

<p>
And so the time had passed until the course was
cleared for the big race.  Mostyn had remained in
the Paddock almost to the last minute, and then
Royce had hurried him back to the coach.  They
had remained close to the railings, however, to see
the preliminary canter.
</p>

<p>
"I don't fancy the favourite," Royce repeated.
"Lochiel may have won the Guineas, but he's got
a devilish uncertain temper.  He'll either win in
a walk or come in with the ruck.  But there's a lot
of good stuff," he continued, as the horses galloped
down the course, followed by the comments of
the crowd, "and it promises to be an uncommonly
open race."
</p>

<p>
Anthony Royce's prophecy was correct.  The
race proved an extremely open one, and moreover
it was full of surprises, notably the early defeat
of the favourite and the prowess of a rank outsider.
Lochiel made a bad start and dropped out long
before the horses had come into the straight, while
Peveril, who had hardly been considered at all and
who stood fifty to one in the betting, got away
ahead and maintained his lead almost to the finish.
At Tattenham Corner Peveril, a lanky, ungainly
horse, bestridden by an American jockey who bore
the colours of an unpopular financier, was still,
though almost imperceptibly, in advance.  The
jockey, craning forward and sitting almost upon the
horse's neck, was making liberal use of his whip.
</p>

<p>
Royce took the field-glasses from Mostyn's
unconscious hand.  "Peveril, by all that's holy!"
he muttered.  "A dark horse.  Is this one of
Isaacson's tricks?"  The next moment he was
yelling "Hipponous!  Come along, Hipponous!"
for he had caught the glitter of the silver as Sir
Roderick's horse, almost neck to neck with another,
swept into view.
</p>

<p>
And now a moment of palpitating silence fell.
Four of the horses were almost abreast, and another
couple only a few paces behind.  Mostyn, standing
up upon the coach and straining his eyes, felt his
heart thumping against his chest and his knees
knocking together because of the thrill that ran
down his spine.  He wanted to shout, but he, too,
was affected by the spell that had fallen upon
that great throbbing mass of humanity; his tongue
clave to the roof of his mouth; his lips were
numb, paralysed.  In a few moments he knew
that he would lend his voice to the great
cry that must go up from the multitude; then
would come relief from a strain that was near
the breaking point.
</p>

<p>
He had no bet upon the race, save for a couple
of shares in a sweepstake that had been organised
on the way down; yet, perhaps, none in that vast
throng, however interested, however deeply involved,
felt the emotion of the moment as keenly as Mostyn
Clithero.  It was the awakening of a new sensation,
the rousing of a new passion, something that had
been crushed down and was asserting itself with
the greater strength now that it had at last
obtained the mastery.  It was the love of sport
for its own sake; Anthony Royce had seen quite
enough of his new friend during the day to realise
that.
</p>

<p>
The silence broke.  Like an oncoming billow
a low mutter, gradually swelling and rising, went
up from the crowd.  Mostyn had the impression
of two vast waves facing each other, arrested in
their onward rush and leaving a clear space between.
He felt himself an atom amid a myriad of atoms in
a turbulent sea: he had been in the depths, unable
to breathe, oppressed by a great weight, but now,
as he rose to the surface, the tension was relaxed,
the strain broken.  He could see, he could hear,
he was shouting with the rest, alternately clapping
his hands and lifting his hat in the air, yielding
himself absolutely to an excitement which was as
new to him as it was delightful.  Never before had
his pulses throbbed so quickly, his nerves felt so
completely on the stretch.
</p>

<p>
The horses swept by.  It was a fine, a memorable
race, a race to live in the annals of great sporting
events.  There was every excuse for Mostyn's
excitement.  His was not the only heart to beat
quickly that day.
</p>

<p>
Three horses, almost abreast, approached the
winning-post.  They were Peveril, Black Diamond,
and Hipponous; a fourth, Beppo, had dropped a little
behind, evidently done.  Peveril was not in favour
with the crowd; it was mainly for Hipponous that
the cry went up.  Mostyn yelled the name of Sir
Roderick's colt till he was hoarse.
</p>

<p>
"Come on Hipponous!  Hip&mdash;Hip&mdash;Hipponous!"
</p>

<p>
And at the last moment, just as it seemed that
Sir Roderick's hopes were to be dashed to the
ground, Hipponous made a brave spurt.  He was
placed between the other two, his flanks just visible
behind them.  Suddenly these flanks were no
longer seen; the three horses appeared a compact
mass, a mass of blended and harmonised colour.
Mostyn seemed to see the silver and scarlet through
a yellow mist, for the sun's rays fell slantingly
over the course; they caught the gold, the pink
and the mauve which distinguished the jockeys
upon Peveril and Black Diamond, as well as the
silver and scarlet of Hipponous, blending the whole
into a scintillating gold, all the more vivid for the
black background of humanity rising tier upon tier
to the highest level of the Grand Stand.
</p>

<p>
Which horse, if any, had the lead?  It was
impossible to say.
</p>

<p>
They flashed past the winning post, a gleaming
mass of colour.  Three horses, neck to neck as it
seemed to the crowd.  Which had won?  Was it&mdash;could
it be&mdash;a tie for the three of them?  There
was a note of doubt in the yelling of the mob.
</p>

<p>
"Peveril&mdash;no, Black Diamond!" "I tell yer
it was 'Ippernous!  Wait till the numbers go up!"
</p>

<p>
Beppo and the other horses which had been
well in the running, sped by in their turn; then
came the stragglers with the favourite, Lochiel, last
but one.  A groan of derision went up as he
passed; it was a bad day for his jockey, who
happened to be Martin's chief rival.
</p>

<p>
After that the course became a sea of black,
rushing humanity; the two great waves had broken
and the space between them was annihilated.
And presently there was another roar from the
crowd, no longer of doubt.  The numbers had
gone up, and, a little later, the "all right" was
cried.  Hipponous first; Black Diamond and
Peveril tied for second place.  Bravo, Hipponous!
Hurrah for Sir Roderick Macphane!
</p>

<p>
Another Derby had been won, and the victory
was to the best horse.  Sir Roderick Macphane had
realised the ambition of his life, and Mostyn
Clithero had caught the infection of a great passion.
The latter, no doubt, was but a small event in
itself, but the young man felt vaguely, as he stood
there gazing straight before him, though the race
was over, that he had somehow reached a turning
point in his life.

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN ACCEPTS A CHALLENGE.
</h3>

<p>
"You enjoyed it?"  Anthony Royce laid his
hand on Mostyn's arm and looked smilingly into
his face.  It was palpably a superfluous question,
for Mostyn's appreciation was plainly writ upon
every feature.  He was flushed and his lips were
quivering, nor could he give an immediate answer,
finding it hard to struggle back from the new world
in which he had been revelling to the commonplaces
of life.
</p>

<p>
Yet he felt that he was being keenly scrutinised;
that those sharp grey eyes were fixed upon him,
taking in every detail of his appearance, reading
him like a book, gauging his emotions, studying,
not only his face but his very soul.  He wondered
if he appeared a fool, and grew hot at the thought.
</p>

<p>
"It's my first Derby," he said apologetically,
taking refuge in a self-evident fact.  "I have
never seen a race before."
</p>

<p>
"And you enjoyed it?"  Royce repeated his
question, rather for the sake of opening conversation
than for any other reason.
</p>

<p>
"Enjoyed it!"  Mostyn placed a heavy accent
upon the first word.  "Why, I don't think I have
ever enjoyed anything so much in all my life.
I haven't been alive till to-day.  Oh!" he cried,
clasping his hands together, and yet half ashamed
of giving utterance to such a sentiment, "how I
should like to win a Derby myself!"
</p>

<p>
Royce laughed, aloud this time.  "Who knows?"
he, remarked; "the future is on the knees of the
gods."  Once more his grey eyes appeared to be
reading the young man's face, taking in every
detail of his appearance.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn Clithero was good to look at, or so the
older man was telling himself, as he wondered if
it could be possible that an idea which had come
into his head earlier in the day, might have foundation
in fact; that reminiscent look, that semblance
of gazing back into the past, had returned to
Royce's eyes, and for the moment he seemed to
have forgotten all else.
</p>

<p>
"There is something in the boy's face that
reminds me of her," he was muttering to himself.
"It's about the eyes or about the mouth&mdash;I'm
not quite sure which.  Anyway, if I should turn
out to be right, the lad's got nothing of his father
about him, and I'm glad of that; I'm glad of that."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was indeed a young man whose personal
appearance might attract attention.  He was tall,
standing well over six foot, and broad of shoulder
in proportion.  His athletic training had done
much for him, and he was in every way, physically
as well as mentally, a contrast to his two
brothers.  He had often been told, indeed, that
he resembled his mother, who in her younger
days had been stately and handsome, a recognised
beauty in London society, while James and Charles
were always supposed to take after their father.
Mostyn had fair hair, which he wore cut short,
striving thereby to overcome its tendency to curl,
an attempt at which he was not always quite
successful; his eyes were blue, very large and
gentle, though they could be stern at times, as
could his lips, which were otherwise prone to smile.
</p>

<p>
Anthony Royce, who had a keen insight into
the minds of men, and who had observed the boy
very carefully almost from the first moment of
their meeting, was pleased with what he had seen,
and, for more reasons than one, felt well disposed
towards Mostyn Clithero.
</p>

<p>
He glanced at his watch.  "I guess we'll stop
here awhile," he said; "it's restful.  Besides,
I want to have a quiet chat with you."  He took
a bulky cigar-case from his pocket, extracted a
large and dark cigar, which he proceeded to light
up.  Then he offered the case to his young friend.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn shook his head.  He did not smoke; it
was one of those things to which his father objected.
</p>

<p>
They had been standing upon the box of the
coach, and it was here that they seated themselves,
Royce occupying the driver's place.  He puffed
thoughtfully at the cigar before breaking the silence.
Mostyn sat silent too, wondering what this new
friend of his would have to say, and why Anthony
Royce, the American millionaire, should have
apparently taken so much interest in him.  Mostyn
had hardly given a thought to the matter before,
but now he was more collected, more himself, and
the things seemed strange to him.
</p>

<p>
"I have a curious idea," so Royce began at last,
"that though you and I have never met before,
Clithero, I was once acquainted both with your
mother and with your father.  I thought so from
the first moment we met in Eaton Square, and
I have been watching you and have noticed all
manner of little tricks of expression which remind
me of Mary Clithero&mdash;Mary Willoughby as she was,
she who I fancy must be your mother."  He was
gazing straight before him, blowing out great
clouds of smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my mother's name was Willoughby!"
cried Mostyn, surprised.  "How strange to think
that you should have known her all those years
ago!  And you never saw her after her marriage?
She is dead now, you know."
</p>

<p>
Royce nodded his head gravely.  "She'd have
been alive to-day"&mdash;he began, then broke off
suddenly.  "I never met your mother as Mrs. Clithero,"
he continued after a pause.  "It would
not have been well for either of us.  We loved
each other once: Mary Willoughby is the only
woman who has ever influenced my life.  We were
to have been married."
</p>

<p>
"I never heard of this; I was never told."  Mostyn
opened wondering eyes and stared at his
companion with new interest.
</p>

<p>
"No, it is hardly likely that you would have
been told."  A great bitterness had come into
Royce's tone.  "The whole affair was a discreditable
one.  Your mother was not to blame; pray
understand that at once."  The words were called
for because Mostyn had flushed and glanced up
quickly.  "I think as dearly of your mother to-day
as ever in the past, and it is for her sake,
Mostyn&mdash;for I must call you Mostyn&mdash;that I have been
taking such an interest in you.  She was deceived,
and so I lost her."
</p>

<p>
He paused; for a second Mostyn could hardly
see his face, because of the volume of smoke that
he emitted from his lips.
</p>

<p>
"Do you wish to speak to me of this?" Mostyn
asked, a slight frown wrinkling his brow.  He felt
instinctively that the whole story might be one
that it would be better for him not to know.
</p>

<p>
Royce shrugged his shoulders.  "No," he said
slowly; "the subject is painful to me even after
all these years, and it might be painful to you to
hear it.  I only wanted to know that you are
really the son of the woman I loved.  Your father
dealt badly with me, Mostyn, and I have never
forgiven him.  I suppose he feels just the same
towards me.  John Clithero was always a hard
man, the sort of man who would never forgive
anyone whom he has injured."  The words were
spoken with bitter sarcasm.  Mostyn looked away
and shuffled with his feet, for he knew that they were
true, and yet, since they were spoken of his father,
he felt vaguely that he was called upon to resent
them.
</p>

<p>
"That brings me to my point," Royce went on,
after a moment's pause.  "I think I am right in
believing that you have come to the Derby to-day
without your father's knowledge, and if he knows
there will be the devil to pay.  I don't suppose
Clithero has changed much, and, according to his
ideas, a man who ventures upon a race-course is
travelling the devil's high road.  It's wonderful
what some men's minds are capable of!"  Royce
took his cigar from his mouth and gazed at Mostyn
from under his heavy brows.  "I wonder you've
turned out so well," he commented.
</p>

<p>
"I expect I'm all in the wrong for being here
at all," Mostyn said, the colour flushing his face.
He could never rid himself of that disposition to
blush.  "But I couldn't help it," he went on;
"I wanted to come, the desire of it was in my
blood."  He laughed awkwardly.  "I suppose
I am different somehow to the rest of my
people."
</p>

<p>
"I am very glad you are.  You take after your
mother, Mostyn, for she came of a healthy-minded
stock.  But now, tell me, what will happen when
you get home?  Or do you propose to keep this
little jaunt a secret?"  The grey eyes fixed upon
Mostyn were searching.
</p>

<p>
"I shall tell my father that I went to the Derby,"
Mostyn replied with some defiance in his tone,
for he hated the suggestion of underhand dealing.
"I have made no secret of it to anyone.  My
father is not at home just now, but I shall tell him
when he returns."
</p>

<p>
"Good!"  Anthony Royce knocked the ash
from his cigar, an ash which he had allowed to
grow to inordinate length.  "I like a man who
acts straight and isn't ashamed of what he does.
But there will be a row?"
</p>

<p>
"I expect so."  Mostyn nodded.  What was
the use of denying the obvious?
</p>

<p>
"A serious row?"
</p>

<p>
"Very possibly."  Mostyn fidgeted.  What was
the good of all these questions?  He had put aside
the evil day, determined to live in the present.
He was enjoying himself; why spoil his pleasure?
A bell rang and the police could be seen clearing
the course.  Another race was about to be run.
Mostyn fumbled with his programme.  "Who's
going to win this event?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"A devil of a row, if I'm not mistaken," Anthony
Royce said reflectively, ignoring the question.
"John Clithero would sacrifice his flesh and blood
upon the altar of his principles.  I'm afraid you will
get into trouble, my boy.  Well, what I want to say
is this.  Come to me if things go badly with you.
Don't let any silly pride stand in your way.  I've
got an idea in my head, and you can help me work
it out.  You will be doing me a favour, far more
than the other way about.  You needn't think it
a matter of charity&mdash;I'm not that kind of man.
Furthermore, it's nothing mean or underhand that
I shall ask you&mdash;to that you have my word."  Royce
had evidently read the young man's character very
well.  "Now&mdash;supposing your father shows you the
door&mdash;he may, you know&mdash;will you come to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I will," Mostyn stretched out his hand, a strong,
well-made hand, and the elder man took it in his,
holding it a moment, and looking the boy squarely
in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
"That's a deal," he said, heartily; "I shall expect
to see you, Mostyn."
</p>

<p>
After the next race, a race over which Mostyn's
enthusiasm was again roused, though not to the
same pitch as before, the guests upon Sir Roderick's
coach returned in little straggling groups to partake
of tea.  Sir Roderick himself, flushed with his victory,
did the honours, and received the congratulations of
all his friends.  He was bubbling over with good
spirits, perpetrated innumerable verbal blunders,
at which he was the first to laugh, and distributed
"largesse" freely among the hangers-on about
the coach&mdash;this, until such a crowd of minstrels,
gipsies, and such like had collected that it was all the
grooms could do to disperse them; but it was a
good-natured, cheering crowd, and Sir Roderick was
distinctly enjoying himself.
</p>

<p>
Captain Armitage, his white beard and moustache
contrasting forcibly with his rubicund complexion,
disdained tea, and appropriated a champagne bottle
to himself.  He was less excitable than he had been
on the journey down, but then, as he would say
himself, he was the kind of man whom drink sobered.
Lady Lempiere and Major Molyneux were conspicuous
by their absence, but all the other guests had put
in an appearance.  Lord Caldershot was still assiduous
in his attentions to Rada, who, for her part,
was in a state of delight at having won the coach
sweepstake, as well as several pounds, the proceeds
of her own investment upon Hipponous, plus many
pairs of gloves which she had apparently won off
her cavalier.
</p>

<p>
She was a distinctly pretty girl; Mostyn, who had
had some opportunities of talking to her during the
day, was constrained to admit the fact.  He was
attracted by her, and yet, at the same time, in some
peculiar manner, repelled.  She was unlike any girl
he had ever met.  She had no reserve of manner,
she spoke as freely as a man might speak, and yet
her whole appearance was distinctly feminine.
</p>

<p>
"Rada Armitage is a little savage," so Royce had
explained her to Mostyn.  "She has lived all her
life with that wretched old scapegrace, her father,
for her mother died when she was an infant.  She
has never known a controlling hand.  Heaven knows
how they exist&mdash;Armitage's cottage at Partingborough
is a disgrace to a civilised man.  Rada's
like an untrained filly, and you must take her at that.
She was called after a horse, too, one upon which the
captain won a lot of money the year she was
born."
</p>

<p>
The girl was small in stature, although she was
slim and perfectly proportioned, giving, perhaps, an
impression of inches which she really did not possess.
Her hair was deep black, glossy, and inclined to be
rebellious; her eyes, too, were black, very bright,
piercing, and particularly expressive.  They seemed to
change in some peculiar way with every emotion that
swayed her; one moment they would be soft, the
next they would flash with humour, and then again
they would be scornfully defiant.  As with her eyes,
so it was with her mouth and with her face generally;
to Mostyn she was a puzzle, and he wondered what
her real nature could be.
</p>

<p>
He took the opportunity of dispensing tea to
improve his acquaintance.  He felt that the girl
watched him surreptitiously, and, self-conscious as he
always was, he had an idea that there was a rather
derisive curl upon her lips.  Probably she had not
forgotten his <i>faux pas</i> of the morning.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately he found it more difficult than he
had anticipated to take part in the conversation.
Sir Roderick was telling of the merits of a two-year-old,
named Pollux, which he had in his Irish stables,
and which he had entered for next year's Derby.
</p>

<p>
"If Hipponous hadn't won to-day," he remarked
enthusiastically, "I feel that I should have had
a dead cert with Pollux.  That's saying a lot, of
course, but you never saw such a perfect colt.  Sired
by Jupiter, with Stella for dam&mdash;you can't have
better breeding than that."
</p>

<p>
"Ah&mdash;ah," laughed Captain Armitage, lifting his
glass to his lips with shaking hand.  "That's all very
well, 'Rory,' my boy, but what about Castor?  His
sire was Jupiter, too, and his dam Swandown; she
was a perfect mare, though I never had much luck
with her, and she died after the foal was born.
Still&mdash;there's Castor&mdash;&mdash;"  He broke into one of his cackling
laughs.  "It'll be a race between Castor and Pollux
for the Derby next year."  He stood up, then
realising a certain unsteadiness of his limbs, sat down
again.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick smiled benignly, and proceeded to
explain to the company that this rivalry between
Castor and Pollux was no new thing.  The two colts
had been born within a week of each other, and had
been named, not so much according to their parentage
as because they resembled each other so minutely.
They were both perfect animals, and there was little
to choose between them.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn listened attentively to the conversation,
gathering up scraps of knowledge, and storing
them in his brain.  He talked when he could,
but he would have been wiser to have kept
silent, for, towards the close of the day, and
when preparations for departure were being made,
he committed a <i>faux pas</i> which quite eclipsed his
other efforts.
</p>

<p>
He had allowed his enthusiasm to master him
once more, and had lost guard of his tongue&mdash;as
ill-luck would have it, in the presence of Rada.
He could quite understand how it might be the
height of anyone's ambition to own a Derby winner,
so he exclaimed; then he added&mdash;as a little while
earlier to Royce&mdash;"How I should love to win
a Derby!"  Immediately after which he turned
and enquired of Sir Roderick if Hipponous was not
entered for the Oaks as well.
</p>

<p>
He bitterly regretted that speech, for even
Anthony Royce and Pierce were constrained to
laugh, while as for Captain Armitage, he simply
rolled in his seat.  But it was not that so much
that Mostyn minded, though he stammered and
blushed crimson, and began muttering some excuse.
What hurt him was the look of scorn and derision
that flashed into Rada's eyes.
</p>

<p>
"You win a Derby!" she cried disdainfully.
"Are you sure you know a horse from a cow?
Why, you silly boy, you couldn't win a Derby if
you lived to a hundred!  I'd stake my life on that."
</p>

<p>
Poor Mostyn choked with indignation, the
insult was so deliberate and spoken so openly.
How he wished it was a man with whom he had
to deal!
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;&mdash;" he began hesitatingly, then paused, for
Rada interrupted him.
</p>

<p>
"Would you like to have a bet on it?" she
asked mockingly.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn looked round.  He saw Captain Armitage's
red face suffused and congested with laughter; he
caught a supercilious sneer on the lips of Lord
Caldershot.  He was boiling over with suppressed
rage.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he felt a nudge from the elbow of
Anthony Royce, who was sitting next to him, and
a whisper in his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Say yes.  In ten years."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn did not understand.  The whisper was
repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Bet anything you like you win a Derby in
ten years."
</p>

<p>
The little diversion had passed unnoticed.  Rada
repeated her mocking question.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn pulled himself together.  He had no
time to think, to weigh his words.  He did not
even realise the import of them.  The wrath of
his heart dictated his answer.
</p>

<p>
"I never bet.  But all the same I'll undertake
to win a Derby within reasonable time: ten years&mdash;five
years," he added recklessly, in spite of the
protesting nudge of Royce's elbow.
</p>

<p>
"Jove, what a brave man!" drawled Caldershot.
His languid tone exasperated Mostyn to fury.
</p>

<p>
"In five years," he repeated.  "I'd stake my
life upon it, too.  I call you all to witness."
</p>

<p>
"Whatever's the boy saying?"  It was good-natured
Sir Roderick who intervened.  "I'm not
going to have anybody staking their life upon my
coach.  We can't go upsetting the market like
that."
</p>

<p>
In the laugh that followed Pierce deftly turned
the conversation, and soon, with the bustle of
departure, the whole incident was more or less
forgotten.  Mostyn, however, sat silent and
absorbed.
</p>

<p>
What had appeared a farce to others was to
him very real.  What was this that he had
undertaken to do?  To win a Derby, and in five
years&mdash;he who was utterly inexperienced and who
possessed no resources whatever?
</p>

<p>
What had Anthony Royce meant by inciting
him to such a speech?  He wanted to put the
question, but the American imposed silence upon
him.
</p>

<p>
"We can't talk now.  Don't worry yourself; it
will be all right.  You shall hear from me first thing
to-morrow.  It's no longer a matter of waiting for
the row at home: you've got to be a racing man,
Mostyn, whether your father approves or no."  He
smiled his enigmatical smile, and his shoulders
shook with inward laughter.  During the whole of
the return journey he led the conversation, and
would not allow it to depart from general topics.
</p>

<p>
But at parting he pressed Mostyn's hand
meaningly.  "You are a sportsman from to-day,
my boy," he said.  "Don't forget that.  It's
all part of the scheme, and you have pledged your
word.  To-morrow you shall hear from me and
you'll understand."
</p>

<p>
Pierce walked with Mostyn a few paces, then
hailed a cab.  "I'm going to dine at the club,"
he said.  "What do you say to joining me?"  But
Mostyn shook his head; his one desire now
was to return home, to be alone to think things
out.  He, too, called a hansom and drove to his
father's house in Bryanston Square.
</p>

<p>
A surprise awaited him there.  His sister Cicely
came running down to the hall to meet him, her
hands outstretched, her face pale.  At the same
time Mostyn fancied that he caught sight of the
pasty face of his brother Charles peering through
the half-closed dining-room door.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mostyn!" cried the girl.  "Father's come
back.  He left by an earlier boat and reached
London to-day.  He knows all about the Derby, and
he is furiously angry; he is in his study and wants
to see you at once."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS REBELLIOUS.
</h3>

<p>
Father and son faced each other in the large
oak-panelled study.  The storm had burst, raged,
and subsided, but the calm which had followed
was an ominous one, and liable to be broken at any
moment.  Mostyn recognised that the worst was
yet to come.
</p>

<p>
John Clithero was unaccustomed to opposition.
His rule had been absolute; he had governed with
an iron rod.  He was that greatest of tyrants, a man
conscious of rectitude.  But, perhaps, for the very
rarity of such an event, he could not control his
temper when thwarted.  In this his son had the
better of him.
</p>

<p>
Yet the situation was galling to Mostyn.  It
was undignified to be standing there in his father's
study just as if he were a child awaiting punishment.
His associations with this room were of no
pleasant order, and he hated it accordingly.  John
Clithero had been stern with his children, and had
not spared the rod.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn glanced about him: the study was just
the same to-day as it had been in those early years.
There were the long book-shelves with their array
of handsomely-bound books, which, however, as
far as Mostyn knew, were never touched.  The
heavy oak panelling was oppressive, and the chairs,
covered with dark red morocco, were stiff and
uncomfortable.  There were some plaster casts of
classical subjects on the top of the book-cases,
casts that had become grimy with age, and which
Mostyn had always looked up to with peculiar
reverence.  He glanced at them now, and noticed
that Pallas Athene had been badly cracked,
evidently quite recently, and that the crack had
extended to her nose, part of which had been
broken away.  Pallas Athene presented an absurd
figure, and Mostyn felt inclined to laugh at her.
She was no longer glorified in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
John Clithero sat beside his great desk, a desk
that was old-fashioned in make, for he disdained
modern and American innovations in his own
home, however much he might make use of them
in his business office.  The desk was piled with
papers, which were, however, all carefully bound
with tape&mdash;for the banker was, above all, a man of
method.  He had not asked his son to be seated,
nor had Mostyn ventured to take a chair; during
the whole of the stormy interview he had stood
facing his father, his feet firmly planted together,
his head high.
</p>

<p>
In appearance John Clithero was not the ascetic
that he professed himself.  He was a stout, burly
man, his head sunk low upon his shoulders, his size
and weight suggestive of ill-health.  His hair was
thin and grey, while his eyes appeared imbedded
in heavy masses of flesh.  He came of a good old
country family, but one would not have thought
it to look at him; he was just the type that might
be found as the leading light of a nonconformist
chapel.  He affected black broadcloth, and his
clothes hung loosely even about his portly form.
It may be that his strict morality and his
abhorrence of worldly pleasures had stood him in good
stead, and had helped him to build up the reputation
of his bank, incidentally making a fortune for
himself.  He was no hypocrite, but he knew the
commercial value of his doctrines.
</p>

<p>
"Am I to understand, Mostyn," he said, pouting
out his thick lip, "that you refuse&mdash;you absolutely
refuse&mdash;to give me your word never again to attend
a race meeting?  If that is the case there is very
little more to be said between us."
</p>

<p>
"How can I give you my word, father?"  Mostyn's
voice was not raised, but he spoke with
dogged determination.  "I am not a child.  I am
old enough to see the world with my own eyes.
What harm is there in a race meeting?" he went
on, though he knew that it was useless to argue
with such a man as his father.  "If one is sensible
and moderate&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
John Clithero waved his large fleshy hand with
a commanding gesture.  "I don't intend to discuss
this matter with you, Mostyn," he interrupted,
"or to consider the rights and the wrongs of racing.
I disapprove of it, and that fact should be quite
sufficient for you.  You have grievously offended
me by your conduct to-day, and all the more so
since you had in mind to deceive me; you took
advantage of my absence to do a thing which you
knew I would not permit; you thought that I should
be none the wiser."
</p>

<p>
"That is untrue!"  Mostyn flashed out the
words, resenting the imputation upon his honour.
"I should have told you what I had done on your
return to London.  I made no secret of it."
</p>

<p>
John Clithero sneered.  "I am at liberty to
form my own conclusions," he remarked.  "It is
not usual for young men who disobey their parents
to confess to their misdeeds.  Luckily, though
I cannot trust you, your brothers are to be relied
upon."
</p>

<p>
A wave of anger passed over Mostyn, and his
lips curved disdainfully.  He had quite expected
to be "given away" by his brothers unless he
spoke first.  Their minds were too narrow to give
him credit for honesty of purpose.  Probably the
mischief-maker was the fat and unwholesome
Charles, who had been addicted to sneaking ever
since he was a little boy.  What was more, he had
always been listened to, at least by his father, who
had never discouraged that sort of thing.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn kept his temper under control, however,
and merely shrugged his shoulders.  "I can only
repeat I should have told you that I had been to
the Derby, and that I see no ill whatever in what
I did," he said stolidly.
</p>

<p>
John Clithero drew himself upright in his chair,
and his hands, resting upon his knees, were trembling.
It was just as if they were itching for the cane, to
the use of which they had been accustomed.  "So
you absolutely refuse to make any promise?" he
said sternly.  "You will continue to walk the
evil path?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't admit the evil path," replied Mostyn
doggedly, "and so I can make no promise to keep
from it."
</p>

<p>
"Very well."  John Clithero's hands dropped
from his knees and he rose to his feet, pushing his
chair violently aside.  "Then I cut you adrift,
now and for ever!  You are no longer son of mine.
I wash my hands of you.  Hell is your portion
and the portion of your fellow-sinner!"  As with
all his kind, the word "hell" came glibly and
sonorously to the man's lips.  There were times
when he revelled in biblical phrase, adopting it
freely to the needs of the moment.  He sought to
do so now, but, confused by his rage, he lost
himself in a maze of ambiguity.  Once Mostyn, who
stood quietly listening, supplied him with the
word he needed, a course naturally calculated to
aggravate the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Silence!" stammered John Clithero.  "How
dare you interrupt me, sir?"  He came close to
his son, his hands clenched as though it was with
difficulty that he repressed a desire to strike.  "Off
with you!" he yelled, quite oblivious of the fact
that he was standing between his son and the door;
"and when you find yourself starving in the gutter
don't come to me, or to your brothers, for help.
The door shall be shut upon you, understand that,
as if you were a beggar!"  All unconsciously the
man was betraying his disposition&mdash;for none was
harder upon the beggar in the street than he.
</p>

<p>
"I quite understand.  Will you allow me to
pass?"  In contrast to his father, Mostyn had
lost none of his dignity.  As soon as John Clithero
moved away, recommencing his fierce raging up
and down the room, vowing his son to perdition
in this world and the next, Mostyn stepped firmly
to the door.
</p>

<p>
John Clithero followed him, panting for breath,
a sorry figure.  "Go!" he spluttered, "go to your
vile haunts, to your race-courses!  Go!&mdash;go to the
devil!"  The final exclamation was not meant in
the ordinary vulgar sense, but the man was quite
beyond the measuring of his words.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn made no reply.  He quietly left the
room.  His father slammed the door behind him
with a noise that re-echoed through the house.  It
was the end; the rupture was irreparable.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, biting his lip, pale but determined,
made his way slowly upstairs to his own room.
He was glad of one thing&mdash;that he had not lost
his temper, and that he had not in any way failed
in the respect that he owed his father; for the rest
he felt that he was in the right, and that it was
simply impossible for him to have given the promise
that was demanded of him.  Never to attend
another race meeting, with his instincts, the
instincts that had been aroused in him that day&mdash;such
an undertaking was absurd, impossible.  Who
could say what the future might bring forth,
especially after the events of that day?  And John
Clithero would not have been content with any
half promise; what he had demanded was in the
nature of a vow.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had always feared that something of the
sort might eventually come to pass.  His home,
especially since his mother's death, had never been
a real home to him; he had always felt himself
out of sympathy with his father and brothers,
disliked by them.  There was Cicely, whom he
cared for, but that was all.  He blamed himself
now for not having made provision for such an
eventuality.  What use to him was his classical
education, his reading for the Bar?  He should
have devoted himself to a more practical method
of earning his living.  For the rest he did not care:
it was not as if his mother were alive.
</p>

<p>
"He killed my mother!"  Mostyn muttered the
words between his clenched teeth.  He had often
felt that such was indeed the case, though he had
never allowed himself, even in his own thoughts,
to give expression to the belief.  "I can see it all
now.  She never complained&mdash;oh, no, she never
complained; but it was his treatment of her that
sent her to her grave."
</p>

<p>
Now that he was ready to admit this, little things,
small events which he had hardly noticed at the
time, crowded into his brain.  Again and again he
had found his mother weeping: he could remember
it even when he was quite a small boy, and she
would never explain the reason.  He recalled how
silent she was in her husband's presence, how she
had gradually lost her strength and beauty, how
she had quivered under the lash of his stern
denunciations.  John Clithero had killed joy within
her, then he had broken her spirit, till finally she
herself had drooped and died.  Mostyn remembered
the day of her death; it was very soon after he
had gone to Oxford.  John Clithero had shed no
tear, and the day after the funeral he had gone to
business as usual.
</p>

<p>
"He killed my mother," Mostyn repeated
bitterly; "he crushed the life out of her;
Mr. Royce is right to hate him."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn glanced at the clock upon his mantel-piece
and realised that it was after seven o'clock.
At eight the family would meet for dinner: well,
they would not have his company, neither to-night
nor ever again.  He decided that he would leave
the house at once, taking with him only a small
hand-bag; later on he would send for the rest of
his belongings.  Cicely would see that they were
packed and delivered to him.  It was lucky, he
reflected, that he was not quite penniless&mdash;that
he had, in fact, a sum that could not be much
under a hundred pounds lying to his credit at the
bank, a sum that he had saved out of his not
ungenerous allowance; this would do to tide over
temporary difficulties, at any rate.
</p>

<p>
With feverish hands he began to pack, hoping
that he would be able to leave before the dinner
hour.  He would have liked a word with Cicely;
but as for his brothers, he trusted not to meet
them.  He had kept his temper under control in the
presence of his father, but it would be different with
James and Charles; with them he might express
himself in a manner that he would afterwards
repent.  "The mean sneaks," he muttered to himself;
"and Charles, who is so fond of talking about his
honour!  I am glad to have done with Charles."
</p>

<p>
There was nothing that he regretted.  He could
not even feel that he was deserting Cicely.  Before
very long she would be married to Pierce Trelawny
and then she, too, would be free.
</p>

<p>
As he thought of her, the girl herself burst into
his room.  Her eyes were tear-stained, and her
fair hair was dishevelled.  She stood still, breathing
hard and staring at Mostyn, who was now struggling
with the straps of his dressing-case.
</p>

<p>
"I've told them what I think of them!" she
panted, following the train of her original thought.
"It was Charles who gave you away, Mostyn.
He went straight up to father and told him that
you were at the Derby&mdash;the sneak!"
</p>

<p>
"It didn't matter," Mostyn said, glancing over
his shoulder; "the result would have been just
the same."
</p>

<p>
"What are you doing, Mostyn?"  Her eyes&mdash;they
were gentle eyes of china-blue&mdash;were round
with horror.  "Father is still in his study.  He
hasn't come out, though the dressing-gong has
sounded.  I heard him tramping about as I passed;
was he furiously angry?"  Then again, as Mostyn
had not yet replied to her first question, she asked,
"What are you doing?"
</p>

<p>
"You see."  He tugged viciously at a strap and
then stood erect, facing the girl.  "I am going,
Cicely.  I am leaving the house to-night.  I am
never coming back."  With a low cry she threw
herself into her brother's arms, and her sobs broke
out anew.  It was a long while before Mostyn
could comfort her.  At last he dragged her down
on to a sofa by his side, and explained to her that
it was for the best that he should go.  Luckily
the thought of money and how he should work
for himself in the future did not seem to occur to
the girl; her grief was solely for the loss of her
brother, the only one in the household with whom
she was in sympathy.
</p>

<p>
"It'll be all right, dear," he whispered.  "You've
got Pierce; and when you are married&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She started from him, appalled by a new terror.
"When we are married!" she cried; then, her
voice shaking with anxiety, "Will Pierce and I ever
be married, Mostyn?  I&mdash;I never thought of it
before, but father knows that it was Pierce who
took you to the Derby.  He won't forgive him
either.  He will break off the engagement! and
I&mdash;oh, what will become of me?"
</p>

<p>
Her sobs broke anew, and this time she refused
to be consoled.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN REALISES HIS POSITION.
</h3>

<p>
Poor Cicely was still in tears when Mostyn kissed
and left her; but he had been able to show her
the necessity of avoiding any further scene, and
he had promised to see Pierce that very evening
and tell him all that had happened.  "Pierce
won't give you up, sis," he had comforted her.
"Whatever happens you may be quite sure
of that."
</p>

<p>
"But his father didn't like our engagement,"
she had sobbed.  "I know he only gave way
because Pierce was so much in love.  And now he
knows that my father objects&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You don't know yet that father will object,"
Mostyn had interrupted.  "For my part, I should
think it most unlikely.  The Trelawnys are wealthy
people, and Pierce will come in for a great deal of
money some day.  And father loves gold," he
added bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had decided to spend that night at one
of the big hotels in Northumberland Avenue.  On
the next day he would look out for cheap lodgings,
and when he got settled Cicely could send him
the rest of his belongings.  In the meanwhile,
should there be a letter for him the next morning&mdash;he
was thinking of Anthony Royce's promise to
write&mdash;would Cicely forward it to him at the hotel?
This having been settled, Mostyn, carrying his bag,
made his way down to the hall, whistled for a cab,
and drove away from the house without any interference
with his actions.  A new life was about to
dawn for him.
</p>

<p>
He felt strange upon reaching the hotel and
engaging his room.  He had very little acquaintance
with hotels of any kind, save, perhaps, when he had
stayed at the seaside in the company of his relations.
John Clithero was quite suburban in his ideas of
the annual holiday.  It was a new experience,
then, for Mostyn to find himself alone and
independent in one of London's huge caravansaries, and
it was not altogether without its element of
charm.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself that evening more the man than
he had ever done in his life before; the whole world
was before him, and he had to carve out his own
path through it.
</p>

<p>
He dined alone, in the great restaurant, but he
was too excited to take any particular notice either
of the food that was put before him or of the smart
crowd by which he was surrounded.  He was
anxious for the time to pass so that he might wend
his way to the Imperial Club, which was in Pall
Mall, and so not very far away, and there talk over
the whole matter with Pierce Trelawny.  He
fancied that Pierce might have friends dining with
him, and so he did not like to intrude himself too
early at the club.
</p>

<p>
It was ten o'clock when he gave his name to
the hall porter and asked to see Mr. Trelawny.
Pierce came to him immediately.  His friends had
just taken their departure, for they were due at
the Empire, where the Derby crowd was sure to
collect in force.  All of which Pierce explained
before he had time to notice how pale and distressed
Mostyn appeared.
</p>

<p>
"It's jolly lucky you found me, Mostyn," he
said heartily, "for I might have gone out in another
ten minutes.  But what on earth has brought you
round to the club at this time of the night?  I never
thought you would have been allowed such a
dissipation."
</p>

<p>
"Take me somewhere where we can have a
quiet talk," Mostyn said huskily.  "There has
been trouble, Pierce, and I want to tell you all
about it."
</p>

<p>
Pierce glanced quickly into his friend's face
and realised that there must indeed have been
trouble.  "Poor old chap!" he exclaimed.  "I
was blind not to see that there was something
wrong.  Come along up to the smoking-room;
we can find a corner, and you shall tell
me all about it."
</p>

<p>
As they were about to set their feet on the
broad staircase they were buttonholed by Captain
Armitage, who was coming downstairs to the
hall.  He laid a hand upon an arm of each of the
young men&mdash;almost as if to support himself&mdash;and
began to talk hoarsely of the day's racing.
</p>

<p>
"I dropped a pot," he muttered.  "Infernal
bad luck!  Didn't even back Hipponous.  Lost
my money in backing old Rory's horses so often
that I couldn't think his luck was going to turn.
Damnable&mdash;what?"
</p>

<p>
It was some moments before Pierce could shake
him off; then, as the two young men continued
their way up the stairs, Pierce commented in no
unmeasured terms upon Captain Armitage as a
member of the club.
</p>

<p>
"The fellow makes himself a general nuisance,"
he grumbled.  "He's always hanging over the
tape, and forces his conversation upon everyone
who happens to come near him.  He belongs to
the genus 'club bore.'  The waiters hate him, too,
for he gives endless trouble and never subscribes
a cent to any of the servants' funds.  Then he
is always half-screwed; it's lucky that he doesn't
live in town, for if he did he would spend the whole
of his time at the club."
</p>

<p>
"How did he get in?" asked Mostyn, for the
sake of saying something.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he was quite a decent sort in his younger
days," returned Pierce, "and it's for the sake of
old times that my uncle and other good-natured
people put up with him.  Then they are sorry for
his daughter, Rada&mdash;she has quaint ways&mdash;but
they suit her somehow."
</p>

<p>
"Do they?"  Mostyn spoke the words viciously,
upon a tone of doubt: from his experience of that
afternoon he was not at all inclined to attribute
virtues to Rada.  He felt, indeed, that he disliked
her intensely.
</p>

<p>
They installed themselves in a recess of the
smoking-room, and Pierce, summoning the waiter,
ordered a couple of brandy-and-sodas, though it
was only after considerable persuasion that Mostyn
could be induced to touch spirits.  He was not
a teetotaler, as his brothers professed to be, but
the habits of his home-life dominated him.  It
was necessary for Pierce to point out that a stimulant
was palpably required, and that Mostyn must look
upon it as a medicine.
</p>

<p>
Pierce Trelawny was possessed of a rather
dominant manner.  He was not built upon such
a large scale as Mostyn, though he was well made
and athletic.  He was equally at home plodding
muddy fields with his gun, riding to hounds, or as
a young man about town.  He had dark hair,
very carefully parted on the left side, thin, refined
features, and his dress was always immaculately
correct in cut and style.  He enjoyed a liberal
allowance from his father&mdash;a good old country
squire&mdash;and upon the death of the latter he would
inherit a property of very considerable importance.
He had no profession, finding life quite full enough
without one.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn made no further objection, but took
a long draught from the tall tumbler when it was
set before him.  The piece of ice that floated on
the liquid was cool against his lips, and he liked
the touch of it.
</p>

<p>
And so, a little fresh colour creeping into his
cheeks, he told his story, and Pierce listened
attentively, with only an occasional interruption,
an interruption that usually took the form of some
muttered comment by no means flattering to
Mr. John Clithero.
</p>

<p>
"He's an impossible man, your father," Pierce
exclaimed when Mostyn had concluded, "And
the ghastly part of it is that he is quite sincere,
fully convinced that he is in the right and that
all the world who disagree with him are in the
wrong.  In a way he's just like my old uncle with
his Tory politics.  Your father is stubborn and
pig-headed in a different and unpleasant direction;
that's all there is between them."
</p>

<p>
"He killed my mother; he bullied her to death.
My brothers are his idea of rectitude.  That's the
kind of man my father is."  Mostyn spoke bitterly,
as he felt.  Never before in his life had he allowed
himself to breathe a word against his father,
whatever his own feelings may have been; but it was
different now.
</p>

<p>
He gulped down one or two mouthfuls of his
brandy-and-soda, then glanced up at his friend,
who appeared lost in thought.  "I'm not only
worrying about myself, Pierce," he said.  "It was
Cicely who asked me to see you this evening.  You
see it is quite possible"&mdash;he broke off, hardly
knowing how to explain himself.
</p>

<p>
"I see it is."  Pierce drummed his fingers restlessly
on the ornate little table before him.  "Your
father knows I induced you to go to the Derby,
and he may forbid Cicely to see me again.  I'm
inclined to think that that's what is going to
happen."  He frowned, staring at his tumbler.
"Of course, I shan't give her up," he went on,
"but things may pan out badly for us.  My old
dad hates your father, and he was wild when he
knew that I had fallen in love with a Clithero.
I don't know how he'll take it if there should be
any opposition on your father's side.  He likes
Cicely, so he may tell me to go ahead and marry
her, or he may say that it's a good thing for
me the engagement is broken off.  Cicely is under
age, too, and won't be free to do as she likes for
another year.  It's a devil of a mess: anyway,
I shall see Mr. Clithero first thing to-morrow
morning and have it out with him," he added with
decision; "and I rather think the interview will
be a stormy one."  He pursed up his lips, thinking
that he was perhaps better able than Mostyn to
hold his own with the redoubtable John Clithero.
</p>

<p>
"What about yourself, Mostyn?" he asked,
after a pause.  "It strikes me I've been selfish,
thinking of my own troubles, which may or may
not eventuate, while you've got a very real one
to face.  In some ways it may be for the best, for
you had a rotten time at home, and the row was
bound to come sooner or later.  I don't know
how you and Cicely were ever born in the Clithero
family," he added sapiently.  "You are not like
the rest of them, and so I suppose you must have
got the blood of some more sporting ancestor in
your veins.  But what do you mean to do?" he
went on; "for I don't suppose you have any idea
of making up the quarrel?"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn shook his head.  "No," he replied.
"I'm going to fight for myself.  Unfortunately
I don't think I'm good for much.  Of course, I shall
have to give up the Bar."
</p>

<p>
"That's a pity," mused Pierce; "why should
you?"
</p>

<p>
"I've got no money of my own except a hundred
in the bank.  My father won't give me another
penny, so I must just put my shoulder to the
wheel."
</p>

<p>
"A clerk on a pound a week, or something
ridiculous of that sort," said Pierce half derisively.
"That won't do for you, Mostyn.  But you needn't
worry your head about it; I'll get my father or my
uncle to find you something more suitable: I've
got plenty of influential friends."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Mostyn made no answer, but once
more lifted his tumbler to his lips; when he spoke
it was with decision.  "No," he said.  "It's
awfully good of you, Pierce, and I haven't the
smallest doubt that you could do as you say, but
there is nothing that your father or your uncle
could give me&mdash;nothing well paid, at any rate&mdash;that
I should be fit for.  It would be just the same
as taking charity."
</p>

<p>
Pierce was loud in his protest against such
principles as these, but he argued in vain.  Mostyn
had quite made up his mind; he had thought it
all over during his solitary dinner, and had decided
upon his course of action.  He would accept help
from no one.  He would undertake no work unless
it was such as he conscientiously felt he was able
to perform.  Of course, he had not forgotten
Anthony Royce; but if it was money that the
latter proposed to offer him, money to be expended
upon racing, then, in the light of the present
position, Mostyn did not see his way to accept.
What, after all, did his foolish words spoken upon
the coach matter?  They were uttered in a moment
of heat, and no one would remember them.  He
had to think of earning his living now: he had
probably been to his first and last race meeting.
</p>

<p>
He had decided to try his luck with journalism;
he had an aptitude for writing, and he had a friend
who was on the staff of an important London
paper.  He would look up Arden Travers on the
morrow and take the journalist's advice as to the
proper manner of setting to work.
</p>

<p>
Pierce expressed his opinion that this was
a grievous folly, but at the same time he could
not help admiring Mostyn's pluck.  There was,
at any rate, no harm in trying.  So nothing was
said on the subject of help to be provided from
outside sources, and the two young men parted
at about half-past eleven, after making an
appointment to meet the following evening, when Mostyn
would report how he had got on with his journalist
friend, and Pierce would relate the result of his
interview with John Clithero.
</p>

<p>
As he was about to leave the club, Mostyn was
accosted by Captain Armitage, who was still
hovering about the hall.
</p>

<p>
"Are you going?  That's a good thing, for I'm
just off, too."  The captain's voice had grown
still more husky, and he dragged his feet across
the stone floor with a shambling gait; nevertheless,
he was quite master of himself.
</p>

<p>
"I'm glad I caught sight of you," he said with
assumed geniality of tone, "for I was going away
by myself, and I hate being alone.  We'll walk
together a bit, my young friend, and you shall tell
me of your ambitions to run race-horses and to
win the Derby."  He chuckled as he spoke, with
an irritating noise in the depth of his throat, and
he passed his arm under Mostyn's, leaning heavily
upon it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not going far," Mostyn said shortly; "only
to Northumberland Avenue.  Perhaps I'd better
help you into a cab."
</p>

<p>
The old man shook his head.  "I want a little
fresh air first," he mumbled.  "It does me good
to walk part of the way home, and I love the
London streets at this time of night."  He waved
his free hand.  "It's life," he chuckled, "and it
makes me think of the days when I was a boy
and full of life.  It's too early to go home
yet."
</p>

<p>
"Where do you live?" asked Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
"Bloomsbury," was the muttered answer.
"Lodgings&mdash;a dirty hole; not fit for a gentleman
to live in&mdash;not fit for a girl like Rada.  People
don't know where we stay when we are in London;
I keep it dark."  As a matter of fact, everybody
who knew Captain Armitage knew that his
lodgings were of the poorest; he made the same
confession to everybody, when, as was usually the
case towards night, he exchanged the braggart for
a sort of maudling sentimentality.  By day he
was the old soldier, a man who was as good as any
in the land&mdash;his swagger was proverbial; at night,
or after an exaggerated bout of drinking, his mood
would change, and it was sympathy for which he
craved.  There was nothing he enjoyed more at
such times than to dwell upon his bye-gone
sins.
</p>

<p>
"Walk with me a little way, at any rate," he
urged.  "There is something I should like to
tell you."
</p>

<p>
So Mostyn complied, his good-nature compelling
him; and Captain Armitage, with palpable enjoyment,
recounted his tale of woe.  Of course, it
was false for the best part: the man was a failure
through drink, a fact that was plainly writ upon
his mottled and congested cheeks, which contrasted
so forcibly with his fine white beard and moustache.
Certainly, he had sufficient means to indulge his
passion for the racecourse, though none but himself
knew if it was upon this, and this alone, that
he spent his income.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn felt constrained to remonstrate.  "I
didn't think you were in such desperate straits,
Captain Armitage," he said.  "What about
Castor?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  The old man drew himself up with
a sudden jerk.  "You remind me: that's just
what I wanted to talk about.  Castor's my horse,
a two-year old; you wouldn't find a better if you
searched the United Kingdom from end to end.
Old Rory's Pollux isn't in it with the colt.  A
Derby winner, sir, if I know anything about racing.
Well, I can sell Castor if I think fit."  He glanced
meaningly at Mostyn as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Why would you sell Castor if you feel so sure
about him?" queried Mostyn, "There may be
a fortune in the horse."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, but I'm broke&mdash;broke to the world;
things have been going precious bad with me
lately."  The old man tapped Mostyn on the arm
with his bony knuckle.  "Now, there's you," he
continued, "a young man of promise, a sportsman
in embryo, keen as they make 'em.  You
were saying to-day that you wanted to win a big
race.  Well, here's your chance.  You can have
Castor for a song, a mere song.  What do you say
to fifteen hundred pounds?"  He leered
insinuatingly.  "It's the chance of a lifetime."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn laughed aloud.  Fifteen hundred pounds!
He who had but a tithe of that sum in the world.
However, Captain Armitage was hardly to be
blamed for the error into which he had fallen, for
Mostyn had certainly contrived to give a false
impression that day.  It was all due to that absurd
enthusiasm of his.
</p>

<p>
"I shall never own race-horses," he said humbly.
"I've got no money for such things.  I was only
saying what I felt, not because I hoped ever to do
it really."
</p>

<p>
Captain Armitage's hand dropped from Mostyn's
arm.  His jaw fell and he muttered something in
his beard.  He was annoyed at having been
deceived; he had taken Mostyn for a young
man of wealth and position, or he would not have
wasted his breath upon him.
</p>

<p>
"Then it was bluff?" he said curtly.
</p>

<p>
"Call it what you like."  Mostyn was not
prepared to argue the point.  "It's certainly
true that I have no intention whatever of going in
for racing."
</p>

<p>
Once again Captain Armitage muttered in his
beard, and Mostyn was quite assured that the
remark was not complimentary to himself.  They
walked on a few paces almost in silence, then
suddenly the captain turned his head, and muttering,
"There's a friend of mine; so long!" waved
his hand airily and was hidden in the crowd
that thronged the street.  Mostyn stood still,
and after a moment or so, he saw the unmistakable
figure of his military friend disappearing,
unaccompanied, under the flaming portals of a
public-house.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn found himself standing alone close to
the brilliantly-lit entrance of a well-known music
hall, through the doors of which a crowd was pouring
out, the entertainment being just concluded.  He
had never been inside a music hall in his life, and,
indeed, the whole aspect of the streets at this
time of night was new to him.  Tired as he was
he watched the scene with interest.  Here was
Life, as it was understood by most young men of
his age.
</p>

<p>
Over-dressed men and under-dressed women
passed across the pavement to the cabs, broughams,
or motors which were summoned for them by the
liveried messengers.  Mostyn, as he stood crowded
against the shuttered window of a shop, could see
the bare shoulders, insufficiently covered by rich
opera cloaks, the glint of jewels, the flushed faces;
his nostrils received the vague impression of
perfume; his ears were pierced by shrill whistling,
by the roar of traffic, by the shouting and laughter,
by all the discord&mdash;or was it harmony?&mdash;of a
London night.  And ceaselessly the restless crowd
of the street surged to and fro: all manner of man
and woman&mdash;the satisfied and the hungry, the
well-clad and the ragged, the joyful and the
sad.
</p>

<p>
It was a different aspect of life from that which
he had studied earlier in the day, and it was another
emotion that stirred him as he watched.  For was
it not well that a man should see all sides, that
he should judge for himself?  The policy of
repression, that which he had known all his life
long&mdash;John Clithero's policy&mdash;now, more than ever,
Mostyn saw the fallacy of it.  The thing forbidden
has a fascination which blinds the eyes to its
danger; wilful ignorance may engender excess.
Mostyn knew what it was to struggle with temptation,
but his sense of honour and duty had held
him in check.  A weaker nature might easily
have succumbed.  As he watched, he reflected
upon the attraction which this scene had had for
his imagination; but he was not so sure that he
felt the same about it now.
</p>

<p>
By the curb stood a woman clad in the Salvation
Army dress.  She spoke to many, but was rudely
repulsed.  A stout young man, whose face Mostyn
had not seen, was assisting a smartly-dressed
woman into the hansom which had been summoned
for him.  The Salvation Army girl approached
him.  She lifted her arms and extended them
straight out to the right and left, finally bringing
them forward and pressing them together as if
she were striving against a great weight.  In that
gesture she seemed to concentrate upon one man
alone all the veiled sin, the careless folly of the
scene.
</p>

<p>
"Man," she cried appealingly, "behold thy
handiwork!"
</p>

<p>
He repulsed her roughly, muttering an oath.
He pushed her from him into the gutter.  Mostyn
sprang forward, fearing that she would fall, and at
that moment, as he dragged her back to the pavement,
he caught a glimpse of the face of the young
man who had acted so brutally.
</p>

<p>
There could be no mistaking those pale, pasty
cheeks, nor the thin streaks of nondescript coloured
hair hanging over the forehead&mdash;it was Mostyn's
brother Charles&mdash;Charles, whose idea of honour had
impelled him to play the part of tale-bearer and
slanderer.
</p>

<p>
Recognition was mutual.  For one moment
Charles stood staring at Mostyn in petrified dismay,
then, without a word, he plunged after his
companion into the hansom and was whirled away.
</p>

<p>
As the cab drove off, Mostyn laughed aloud.
He was not really surprised.  He had often had
his suspicions of Charles in this particular direction,
though he had never voiced them.  Charles professed
to be keenly interested in some East End
Mission work, and it was understood that he stayed
occasionally with his friend who conducted the
Mission.  Mostyn remembered that he had arranged
to be absent that particular evening.  Well&mdash;it all
fell in with Mostyn's reflections.  Charles was a
weaker spirit, and he had yielded to temptation&mdash;yielded
dishonourably, hiding his weakness behind
a lie.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was not vindictive by nature, but he was
human enough to be glad that Charles had
recognised him.  Charles&mdash;judging according to
his own nature&mdash;would certainly conclude that his
brother would retaliate upon him, and he would
suffer accordingly.  "Serve him right, too," was
Mostyn's reflection.  "Charles won't enjoy being
found out&mdash;and by me.  I hope his conscience
will prick him&mdash;the sneak!"
</p>

<p>
"Paper, captain? last extry speshul?"  A small
newsboy, keen-eyed and ragged, thrust his wares
before Mostyn, who fumbled in his pocket and
produced a coin.  He did not really want
a paper, but he thought the lad looked tired and
hungry.  He folded his purchase, thrust it away,
and forgot all about it till he was back at the hotel
and in the solitude of his own room.
</p>

<p>
As he undressed he scanned the pages carelessly,
his thoughts in reality far away.  But suddenly
an item of intelligence, under the stop-press news
attracted his attention.  He carried the paper
under the electric light, and, with a gasp of dismay
and genuine regret, perused the paragraph.
</p>

<p>
"At a late hour to-night, intelligence has come
to hand of a fatal accident to the well-known
American financier and explorer, Mr. Anthony
Royce.  Particulars are still wanting, but Mr. Royce's
death is reported to be due to a motor-car
mishap."
</p>

<p>
The paper dropped from Mostyn's hand.  Anthony
Royce, in whose company he had been that very
afternoon, who had evinced so much interest in
him for the sake of his dead and gone mother&mdash;who
had instigated Mostyn's wild speech about
winning a Derby&mdash;Anthony Royce had met with a
sudden and tragic death!
</p>

<p>
Whatever scheme may have been in the
financier's mind, whatever the suggestion that he
wished to propose to Mostyn, here was an end
to it all.  Anthony Royce had carried his plan
with him to the grave.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS PUT ON HIS METTLE.
</h3>

<p>
Some four or five days later, Mostyn found himself
in the private office of Mr. Gilbert Chester, head
partner in the well-known firm of Chester and
Smithers, solicitors.  He had received a mysterious
letter from the firm, requesting him to attend
that day upon a matter of the utmost importance
to himself&mdash;a matter which would be
explained in full when he visited the office.
</p>

<p>
The letter had necessarily reached him in a
round-about way, for it had originally been addressed
to his father's house in Bryanston Square, and had
then been sent on to him to his lodgings&mdash;for he
had allowed no delay before settling himself in an
unpretentious apartment&mdash;by Cicely, to whom he
had confided his address, and who had seen to it
that the rest of his personal belongings had been
packed and delivered up to him.  Mostyn had at
first imagined that the solicitors may have had
some communication to make to him on behalf of
his father, but this would have been strange, for
the latter had never employed the firm of Chester
and Smithers.
</p>

<p>
As he sat with other waiting clients in the outer
office, Mostyn reviewed the circumstances of the
last few days.  These had been anything but
satisfactory, and, indeed, he had already made
a great gap in that hundred pounds of his, for he
had remembered certain debts to tradesmen which
it was incumbent on him to pay since he wished
to begin his new life with a clean sheet.
</p>

<p>
He was very disappointed&mdash;he had found that
his journalist friend was not in London, having been
sent to Scotland to report a big case at Edinburgh;
it might be a week before he returned.  In the
meanwhile Mostyn, in his humble lodgings, was
occupying himself by studying journalism according
to the rules laid down in certain books which
he had purchased, and which professed to give
complete instruction in the art.  He varied this
by visits to the British Museum, which was close
at hand, with some vague idea in his mind that
this was a spot he would have to frequent in the
future, and that it was well to get accustomed to
it at once.
</p>

<p>
As he had feared, matters had gone wrong, too,
with Cicely and Pierce.  The latter had lost no
time in visiting John Clithero.  There had been
an angry scene between the two men, and Pierce
had been incontinently shown the door.
Mr. Clithero had declared that he would never give
his consent to his daughter's marriage with such
a man as Pierce Trelawny while he had any say
in the matter, and if Cicely chose to disobey
him&mdash;well, it would be at her own risk.
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances, Pierce had decided
to go and see his father, who lived at Randor Park,
in Worcestershire.  What the result of this visit
would be was an open question, and as yet Mostyn
had received no news, though his friend had been
gone a couple of days.
</p>

<p>
At last Mostyn was summoned to the presence of
the great man.  Mr. Chester received him with
peculiar warmth.
</p>

<p>
"I am glad you have taken an early opportunity
of seeing us, Mr. Clithero," so Mr. Chester began.
He always spoke of himself as "we" or "us," though,
indeed, Mr. Smithers, the other partner of the
firm, had long since retired.  "We have some
very important intelligence for you."  He cleared
his throat with a little suggestive cough.  "Very
important indeed."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed?" said Mostyn interrogatively, seating
himself in a chair indicated to him by the solicitor.
"I am very much in the dark, Mr. Chester."
</p>

<p>
"The matter concerns the testamentary
disposition"&mdash;Mr. Chester was very precise in
speech&mdash;"of our late client, Mr. Anthony Royce."  The
solicitor toyed with his gold-mounted glasses as he
spoke, and stared hard at his visitor.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Royce?"  Mostyn repeated the name in
amazement.  "Why, I only met Mr. Royce once," he
stammered, "and that was on the day of his death."
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless you have an interest&mdash;a very
considerable interest indeed&mdash;in Mr. Royce's will,
and this will, or, rather, codicil, I may inform you,
appears to have been written hastily, although
duly signed and witnessed, upon the day that
ended so tragically for our client."  The solicitor
carefully polished his glasses with the border of a
silk pocket-handkerchief.
</p>

<p>
"But this is extraordinary&mdash;inexplicable!"  Mostyn
could hardly believe his ears.  It was true
that Anthony Royce appeared to have taken a
peculiar interest in him that Derby Day, and then,
of course, there was the story about his having
once been in love with Mostyn's mother, but that
he should have gone straight home and made a
new will, almost as though he had anticipated the
tragedy that was to come&mdash;this was past
understanding.
</p>

<p>
"Our client was always a man who acted immediately
upon any resolution he may have taken,"
Mr. Chester explained.  "He had evidently made
up his mind that afternoon, the day upon which
he met you, and, as usual, followed his impulse.
Of course, poor man, he could not have anticipated
that he was to meet his death that night; indeed,
as we happen to know, all his preparations were
made for a second expedition into the heart of
Africa.  A fine fellow, Mr. Clithero, a man of
sterling merit, and no one regrets his loss more
than we do.  It was a shocking accident: you
know all the particulars, of course?"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn nodded: the papers had been very full
of the disaster on the day after it had happened.
Anthony Royce, it appeared, had dined at his
London house after his return from the Derby, and
then, at a later hour of the evening, had left London
in his motor-car for his country residence, which
was in the neighbourhood of Ware; it was upon
the road that the accident had happened.  The
night had been very dark, and Royce, who was
driving himself, had apparently, through some
accident to the machinery, lost control of the car
upon one of the steep hills in the neighbourhood.
The motor had dashed into a wall; Royce had been
thrown out, receiving a terrible blow upon the head,
the result of which had been almost immediately
fatal.
</p>

<p>
"Let us come to business, Mr. Clithero," the
solicitor resumed after a brief pause.  "I have
here a copy of the codicil to Mr. Royce's will&mdash;the
codicil which affects yourself.  You will observe
that certain other legacies&mdash;legacies mainly to
public bodies&mdash;are withdrawn in order to make
room for yours.  Mr. Royce was a bachelor, and
apparently he has no relatives in the world, any
whom he, at any rate, cared to benefit.  This
is perhaps lucky for you," Mr. Chester added
meaningly, "for, as you will see, the will is
a peculiar one, and might possibly have been
contested."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was gazing at the paper before him, but
at the moment he could not make head nor tail
of it&mdash;the words all seemed blurred and jumbled
together.  "What does it mean?" he asked
helplessly.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Royce bequeaths to you the sum of two
and a half million dollars," Chester explained
slowly, tapping the table with his knuckles as
though to enforce the significance of his words.
"But there are certain conditions&mdash;certain
conditions," he added, "and you will, no doubt, find
some difficulty in complying with them."
</p>

<p>
"Conditions?"  Mostyn stared helplessly at the
solicitor.
</p>

<p>
"Just so.  The capital sum of which I have
spoken is not to be handed over to you for the
space of a year, though you may enjoy the interest
upon it.  Within this period it is incumbent upon
you to win any one of certain races, the names of
which are formally enumerated.  Some dozen are
mentioned, and they include the principal events
of the year, together with the five classic races.
A sum of one hundred thousand dollars, in addition
to the interest upon the millions, is to be placed
at your immediate disposal, so that as far as money
goes, Mr. Clithero, you should be well equipped for
your task.  Finally, Mr. Royce leaves to you
absolutely his property in Cambridgeshire known as
Partinborough Grange."  Mr. Chester ceased drumming
on the desk with his finger, and adjusted his
pince-nez upon his nose.  "I trust you are already
well conversant with sporting matters,
Mr. Clithero?" he added.
</p>

<p>
"Good heavens, no!"  Mostyn stared aghast,
the corners of his lips drawn down.  "I'm as
ignorant of sport as the babe unborn!  I don't
even know what the classic events are.  The whole
thing is so extraordinary that I don't know what
to say about it; you have dazed me&mdash;taken my
breath away!"
</p>

<p>
"Of course we cannot say what actuated our
client to make such a bequest," said the lawyer
smoothly.  "We have only to deal with facts, and
there is no doubt in the present case everything
is in order.  It is a strange will, but it is not likely
to be disputed.  I presume, Mr. Clithero, ignorant
of sport though you may be, that you will do your
best to carry out Mr. Royce's wishes?"
</p>

<p>
"I&mdash;I suppose I shall."  Mostyn had taken up the
paper from the desk and was pretending to read it;
this, however, was to hide his embarrassment, and to
give him time for reflection.  It was beginning to
dawn upon him that the extraordinary legacy was
a result of the scene upon the coach when he, Mostyn,
prompted by Royce, had undertaken to win a Derby
in five years' time.  This eccentric friend of his had
wished to give him a sporting chance of doing so.
But that Royce should have executed a will that
same day, containing, moreover, such drastic
stipulations, that was the inexplicable part of the whole
thing.
</p>

<p>
Of course there was no question, however, as to
what he must do.  He was put on his mettle; the
means were given him of carrying out his own challenge.
A sense of exhilaration seized him.  Suddenly,
and for no particular reason, Rada's derisive words
flashed into his mind: "You silly boy, you couldn't
win a Derby if you lived to a hundred."  He had felt
those words very deeply, they had stung and wounded
him&mdash;but now, in an extraordinary manner, the
means had been placed at his disposal, and Rada&mdash;not
only Rada, but the whole world&mdash;should see
what he was made of.
</p>

<p>
He pulled himself together and sat upright in his
chair.  "Mr. Royce wanted to make a sportsman
of me," he said, "I can see that.  Well, I shall do
my best to realise his ambition."
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chester smiled, the smile that he reserved
for his most important clients, to which number he
hoped that Mostyn would be added.  "Well, I'm
sure we wish you all success, Mr. Clithero," he said.
He rose and extended a white hand.  "Come and
see us again to-morrow&mdash;let me see&mdash;yes&mdash;at 11.15,
and we will discuss the matter at length.  By the
way," he added, "since you will, no doubt, wish to
visit your new property shortly, we'll write to the
gardener, whose name is Willis, and who has the
charge of it, to notify him that you may be
expected at any time."
</p>

<p>
As Mostyn reached the door Mr. Chester, suddenly
recollecting a duty omitted, called him back.  He
searched for a moment among the papers of his desk,
and finally produced a sealed letter which he handed
to Mostyn.  "This was brought to us to-day,
Mr. Clithero," he explained.  "It was evidently written
by Mr. Royce on the day of his death, and should
have been posted in the ordinary way.  You see it is
stamped though it has not passed through the post.
Mr. Royce may have intended to drop it in the box
himself and accidentally omitted to do so.  It appears
to have been found in his study.  At any rate, it is
addressed to you, and perhaps it may throw further
light upon the matter of your inheritance."  With
which Mr. Chester bowed Mostyn from the room,
and called to his head clerk that he was ready to see
the next client.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn returned to his humble lodgings, the
spirit of elation still upon him.  What an extraordinary
twist had come into his life!  There was no
fear of poverty&mdash;no need to depend upon the charity
of his friends&mdash;for a year, at least, he was rich and
independent, and ultimately&mdash;unless he failed to carry
out what was imposed upon him&mdash;the laugh would
be with him and not with Rada.  He wondered
why he should think so much about Rada, but
of course it was because she had insulted him,
and he had conceived such an antipathy to the
girl.
</p>

<p>
Alone in his own room he opened Anthony Royce's
letter, a letter written, no doubt, when there was no
thought in the writer's mind of the fate that awaited
him.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Mostyn," so he read, "You have bound
yourself to-day to win a Derby in five years.  I
suggested ten&mdash;but that is immaterial.  Well, I have
my own reasons for wishing to help you to do so.  I
am going out of town to-night, but I shall return
to-morrow; come and see me the day after, and we will
discuss ways and means.  I have not the smallest
doubt that when your father learns of your escapade
to-day he will turn you out&mdash;cut you adrift&mdash;but if
he does not do so, my offer may still be acceptable
to you.
</p>

<p>
"You have the true instincts of the sportsman in
you, I have seen that for myself.  Besides, you are
your mother's son and I took to you instinctively
from the first.  That is why I feel justified in helping
you to a sporting career.  I don't know what we
may decide between ourselves, but since I am a
man who takes no chances, I have this evening
added a codicil to my will, and what I shall propose
to you will be much upon the same lines."
</p>

<p>
Here followed a recapitulation of the codicil.  "You
will see from this," the letter continued, "that I have
no intention of making things too easy for you.  It is
a hard task for any man&mdash;even with unlimited
capital&mdash;to pull off one of these races in a year.  But if
you succeed, well&mdash;you will earn a big fortune, and
you may be able to manage the Derby within the
stipulated time.  In any case it gives you a sporting
chance.
</p>

<p>
"You will ask why I do this, and if it is only out
of regard for yourself and for your mother's memory.
It is not only that, Mostyn.  I will confess that it is
by way of revenge upon your father, whom I have
good cause for hating.  You will understand this
when I tell you that he lied about me to the girl to
whom I was engaged&mdash;your mother; that he took
advantage of my absence from England to spread a
calumny which he, better than anyone else, knew to
be absolutely false.  I returned to England to find
my good name injured and the woman I loved the
bride of the very man who had wrought me this
wrong.  I could do nothing at the time, there were
reasons which made me helpless&mdash;I was driven from
England, and became a naturalised American.
</p>

<p>
"But my hatred endured, and, through you, I
may obtain the kind of revenge that is dear to my
heart&mdash;no very bitter revenge perhaps, but one that
appeals to my sense of humour.  Narrow-minded
Pharisee as is your father, nothing will gall him more
than that a son of his should become known in the
world of sport&mdash;and if you accept my offer you will
have to steep yourself in racing.  However, we will
talk this over when we meet&mdash;it is not very likely
that you will be bound by the terms of a will drawn
up by a man in rude health like myself.  I hope to
live to see you win your Derby, my boy&mdash;and for
many years after that.  But, as a safeguard to
yourself, it is just as well that the will is there."
</p>

<p>
A few words of friendship followed, and the
letter closed with Anthony Royce's bold signature.
Mostyn, having read it through several times, threw
himself back in his armchair and gave himself up
to reflection.
</p>

<p>
He realised that the plot was aimed against his
father.  He remembered how Royce's sides had
shaken with silent laughter&mdash;the American was just
the sort of man to devise so subtle a revenge.  Had
Royce been still alive&mdash;had John Clithero been
kinder&mdash;Mostyn might have hesitated before
accepting, but now he had no compunction.
</p>

<p>
"Anthony Royce loved my mother," he muttered
to himself, "and she&mdash;my father killed her by his
cruelty.  Yes, I'll steep myself in racing&mdash;I'll do all
that is desired of me.  I'll keep my word to Rada,
too, and win the Derby.  She won't scoff at me again.
Ah, Miss Rada, it will be my turn to laugh!"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he sprang to his feet and clapped his
hands boyishly together.  "Castor!" he cried.
"Captain Armitage's colt!  The very thing&mdash;entered
for the Derby and all!  Rada thinks a lot of
the horse&mdash;I heard her say so.  So does Sir Roderick.
And the captain wants to sell&mdash;fifteen hundred
pounds&mdash;what's fifteen hundred pounds to me now?"
</p>

<p>
He thought intently for a moment.  "Jove, how
it all works out!" he cried.  "The Armitages live
at Partingborough, and now I'm a man of property
in that neighbourhood.  I'll go and take possession
of the Grange&mdash;I'll go to-morrow.  Then I'll make
my first investment&mdash;I'll buy Castor.  Oh, Rada"&mdash;he
laughed aloud in his glee&mdash;"I wonder what you'll
say if I win the Derby next year, and with the horse
you think so much of?"  His face grew reflective.
"I can't make up my mind what I think of you
really, Miss Rada Armitage," he said slowly, "I
ought to hate you, but I'm not sure&mdash;I'm not sure.
Yet I feel this; you have come into my life&mdash;you
have influenced it&mdash;and we have not done with each
other yet.  You've put me on my mettle, Rada,
and it's going to be a tussle between us."
</p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS SURPRISED.
</h3>

<p>
On the following day Mostyn travelled down to
Partingborough, in Cambridgeshire, by a late afternoon
train.  He had paid a visit to Messrs. Chester
and Smithers that morning, had fully discussed his
plans with Mr. Chester, had learnt that a large sum
of money would be placed to his credit that day, and
that he could draw upon the firm for more should he
require it; then he had broached a subject which had
been worrying his mind during the night.
</p>

<p>
"If the details of this extraordinary will are given
to the public," he said, "it's very plain that my task
will be made more difficult&mdash;for me.  Dealers will
ask what they like for their horses because they
will know that I simply must purchase.  Every
swindler in England will be on my track.  I shall
be exploited right and left.  That's clear, I think.
Now, Mr. Chester, is it essential that the will shall be
published before my year is up?"
</p>

<p>
Mr. Chester gave the matter his very careful
attention.  It was palpably a point of importance.
When he spoke it was in his usual oracular vein.
</p>

<p>
"What you say is very reasonable, Mr. Clithero,
and, upon consideration, we think we can meet you
in the matter.  There will be no difficulty in realising
the estate of the late Mr. Royce, since it is mainly in
American gold bonds, payable to bearer; and, since
the ultimate trusts are of such a nature that they
will not come into force for a full year, we see no
reason why probate should not be delayed for the
period you require.  This must, of course, be subject
to the consent of the American agents, but we do not
anticipate difficulty with them."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn felt intensely relieved, and said so.  He
had been dreading the amount of public interest that
would certainly have been aroused in his undertaking.
Now he would confide in Pierce and Cicely,
but in no one else.
</p>

<p>
This point settled, Mostyn took his departure, after
announcing his intention of going down to Partinborough
that day.  He had an idea in his head that
Mr. Royce may have had some subtle object in
mind in bequeathing him this estate, situated, as it
was, so close to the home of the Armitages.  Was it
perhaps Castor of which he had been thinking&mdash;or
could he have desired to throw Mostyn and Rada
together?  It was impossible to guess.  All Mostyn
knew of his property was that it had been rarely
occupied by the American, and that the house was
an old one, only partly furnished and very much out
of repair.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn studied racing literature as he travelled
down in the train, totally ignoring magazines, of
which he was usually fond, and every form of light
reading.  He had purchased the evening paper
solely with the object of absorbing the sporting
intelligence.  Ruff's Guide and a stud book bulged
prominently in the pocket of his blue serge coat; he
had promised himself that these works should be
his inseparable companions during the months to
come.  Oh, yes, he would soon be well up in sporting
technicalities; he laughed at himself now as he
remembered his blunders on Derby day.  To have
asked the age of Hipponous&mdash;to have suggested that
Hipponous should run in the Oaks&mdash;and above all
to have been taken in by that old joke about the
Waterloo Cup&mdash;his cheeks reddened even now as he
thought of it.
</p>

<p>
He wished he had been able to talk it all over with
Pierce, but Pierce was still away at his father's house
in Worcestershire: Mostyn had received a letter from
him that afternoon, just as he was leaving for the
station.  He had perused it hastily, and then
thrust it into his pocket.  Now, having time at
his disposition, he drew it out and read it for the
second time.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Pierce," he muttered to himself, "poor old
chap!"  The letter was not a cheerful one, as,
perhaps, was to be expected.  Old Mr. Trelawny
had not shown himself very amenable, this although
he was admittedly fond of Cicely for her own sake.
He was a bluff old gentleman of the old school,
a thorough sportsman, and he cordially despised
John Clithero and John Clithero's doctrines.  He
listened with considerable interest to the story of
Mostyn's rebellion and the refusal of the latter to
submit to his father.  "A brave lad!" he had cried,
"I like his spirit."  He had repeated this several
times, somewhat to Pierce's annoyance, whose
thoughts were concentrated upon his own affairs.
</p>

<p>
Finally, Pierce had obtained a concession.  Since
Cicely would not be twenty-one till the expiration of
another twelve months, Pierce was to wait a year
without seeing or writing to the girl, and if he was of
the same mind at the end of that time, Mr. Trelawny
would offer no further opposition.  Pierce might
marry his sweetheart, regardless of John Clithero's
disapproval.  But the year's probation was to be a
<i>sine qua non</i>.
</p>

<p>
"If you deceive me over that, my boy, there'll be
a row," so the old gentleman had asserted with a good
deal of vigour and a quaint raising of the eye-brows
that was peculiar to him.  "Jove, I'll cut you off
like Clithero has cut off Mostyn.  Remember that.
Write to Cicely and tell her what I say&mdash;and then not
another letter.  That's my decree, and you'd better
stick to it."
</p>

<p>
"I can't quite make the governor out," so Pierce
wrote.  "He spoke very decidedly, but there was a
queer look in his eyes, as though he thought it was
rather a joke to forbid me seeing the girl I love for a
whole year.  I suppose he thinks I shall find someone
else in the meantime, but I won't, and that's very
certain.  We shall just have to wait the year&mdash;and
that will be hard enough for both of us."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, having read the letter with genuine sympathy,
put it carefully away, reflecting that it was
strange that Pierce, like himself, should have a year's
probation before him.  He had written to his friend
the night before, telling him, in confidence, something
of his accession to fortune and the conditions imposed
thereon, inviting him also to come to Partinborough
Grange and talk the future over as early as possible.
</p>

<p>
Partinborough station reached, Mostyn descended
from the train and looked about for Samuel Willis
and the conveyance which he had asked by letter to
be sent to meet him.  But Samuel Willis was
conspicuous by his absence, nor was there a sign of any
kind of carriage on the long level road outside the
little wayside station.  Could it be possible that his
letter had miscarried, and that the gardener had not
been warned of his coming?
</p>

<p>
Under these circumstances it was necessary for
Mostyn to hire a cab, and there was a delay of some
twenty minutes&mdash;which Mostyn spent at the Station
Hotel&mdash;till the ramshackle old conveyance was
brought round.  The little town of Partinborough,
he learnt, lay about a mile from the station, on the
main road to Newmarket, and the Grange occupied
a rather isolated position another mile further on.
</p>

<p>
It was nearly seven o'clock when, having passed
through the little town and then negotiated some
extremely narrow and rutty lanes, the cab came to a
halt for a moment, while the driver descended from
his box to open a wooden gate that gave access to a
drive through a small wood.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn concluded, and concluded rightly, that he
was now upon his own property.  He gazed about
him with curiosity.  The road branched, and the
wood was denser than he had first thought.  To
the left there was an incline, below which, and just
visible through the thickly-massed trees, Mostyn
could discern the glimmer of a little stream.  Upon
the other side the trees became gradually less dense,
till between them an open space, evidently an
undulating lawn, could be distinguished.  Presently,
the road made an abrupt turn in this direction, and
the house came in sight.
</p>

<p>
Even at a cursory view it was evident that
Partinborough Grange was of considerable antiquity.  It
was a house of no great size, but it had many gables
and was pleasantly irregular in proportion.  It was
ivy-covered, too, almost to the roof, and the windows
were framed with rose creepers.  The porch before
which the carriage drew up was a veritable mass of
white and red blooms.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn's heart leapt delightedly within him.  He
had often pictured to himself a house like this, and
now his dreams were realised.  Partinborough Grange
was his own&mdash;absolutely his own&mdash;and not only the
Grange, but this wide expanse of wood, this spreading
lawn with its carefully-tended flower-beds, and its
pergola of roses; however negligent Samuel Willis,
the gardener, may have been in not attending to
instructions as to meeting the train, he was
undoubtedly accomplished at his craft.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn alighted from the carriage, and almost as
he did so, the door was thrown open, and a tall man,
curiously thin and cadaverous of face, made his
appearance.  His manner was nervous, but he spoke
civilly, and was evidently anxious to appear at his
best.
</p>

<p>
"You are Mr. Clithero, sir?" he began, awkwardly.
"I am Samuel Willis."
</p>

<p>
"You had my letter?" interrupted Mostyn,
seeing that the man hesitated as though at a loss for
words.  "I expected that you would have sent a
cart to meet me.  I mentioned the time that I should
arrive."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir."  The man blurted out his explanation.
"But unfortunately I didn't get your letter till
about half an hour ago.  It was like this, my boy, who's
workin' for Colonel Marchmont at Mowbray Hall,
a couple of miles on the other side of Partinborough,
met with a bad accident last night, and me and my
missus went out early this mornin' to be with him.
That's how it was, sir, that neither of us saw your
letter.  It's a good thing I came back when I did.
I meant to fetch the cart and bring him home, for
the doctor says he must lie up a bit."
</p>

<p>
"I see," said Mostyn, pleasantly, evincing no
annoyance whatever&mdash;this, evidently, very much to
the gardener's relief.  "I found my own way up
quite safely, you see.  And I am very sorry to hear
about your son&mdash;I hope he isn't seriously hurt."
</p>

<p>
Willis replied that he anticipated no danger.  The
boy was raw at his work, and had carelessly damaged
his foot with a scythe.  The doctor had patched
him up, and he would be on the mend in a day or
two; but in the meantime, there was the necessity
of driving over to Mowbray Hall that evening to
fetch both Willis's wife and his son back to the
cottage.
</p>

<p>
"You can go as soon as you have shown me over
the place," Mostyn said, "I don't the least mind
being left alone&mdash;that is, if I can get something to
eat, and if there is a bed ready for me to sleep on.
What time do you expect to return?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, sir, the doctor's coming round again a
little before nine, he said.  I expect we could be
back at the cottage by ten.  In the meanwhile, I can
arrange for your dinner, and make you quite
comfortable for the night."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, then," agreed Mostyn, "I shall
manage quite well for myself after you have gone."  He
turned and settled with the driver of his cab,
paying him liberally out of the fulness of his heart,
and then requested Samuel Willis to lead the way
into the house.  His luggage&mdash;such as it was, for
he had not thought well to bring much with him,
being uncertain as to the length of his stay&mdash;had
already been carried into the hall.
</p>

<p>
"You know all about my having become the
owner of the Grange?" Mostyn said, as he followed
the gardener.  "I suppose Messrs. Chester and
Smithers gave you the full particulars."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," returned the man civilly, "but we did
not expect that you would be coming down so soon,
or I should have been on the look out for a letter."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn made some complimentary remark about
the garden, and then added with a laugh, "I understood
that the house was in a dilapidated condition,
a sort of ruin, in fact.  I am pleasantly surprised to
find it so well kept."
</p>

<p>
"It's better from the outside than within," returned
Willis, "as you will see for yourself, sir.  My
wife does her best, but there's more work than one
woman can manage.  There are only some four or
five rooms furnished, and the others&mdash;well, they
would need a lot of doin' up before they could be
occupied.  As for the garden&mdash;well, I can manage
that, and I love my flowers."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was staring round the hall in which he stood.
It was square of shape, panelled in oak, and a gallery
ran round two sides of it&mdash;a gallery which was
approached by an uncarpeted flight of stairs at the
far end.  There was but little furniture, though
everything that Mostyn's eyes rested upon was
quaint and old-fashioned.  There were high-backed
chairs, elaborately carved, a great oaken coffer, and
a fine old grandfather's clock, the loud ticking of
which sounded pleasantly to the ear.  The fireplace
was large in proportion to the size of the hall, and the
hearth was broad; there were delightful ingle nooks
to either side of it.  Against the opposite wall there
was an organ, a small affair, and evidently of modern
make: its pipes, which had been gilded and painted,
were now discoloured, and harmonised quaintly with
the more antique decorations of the hall.  The floor
was uncarpeted, but a few fine rugs, bear and tiger
skins, lay about.  A large lamp was suspended in the
centre, and Samuel Willis now occupied himself with
the lighting of this, for the dusk was closing in.
</p>

<p>
There were two other rooms upon the ground floor
which had been furnished, and these were just as
quaint and old-fashioned, both in design and
equipment as the hall itself.  The broad oaken beams
that traversed the ceilings indicated their age.  Of
the two, the drawing-room presented the greater
semblance of comfort and modernity.  It had pretty
chintz furniture, comfortable arm-chairs, and the
pictures on the walls were bright water-colour
landscapes.  The walls themselves, above the oaken
panelling, were distempered in white, and, unlike
the other rooms, there was a good carpet covering the
whole floor.  The windows gave direct access to the
garden, and as it stood partly open, the scent of
roses was pleasantly wafted to Mostyn's nostrils.
There were a couple of shaded lamps, which the
gardener proceeded to light, and some of the tall
vases that stood upon the mantel-piece and in other
parts of the room had been filled with bunches of
great red roses; Mostyn imagined that this had
been a kindly attention upon the part of Willis,
and felt grateful to the man.
</p>

<p>
The dining-room was not altogether so cheerful an
apartment.  It was panelled from floor to ceiling in
oak, which in places was very palpably rotting away.
There were no pictures upon the wall, nor any
attempt at the lighter ornamentations which prevailed
in the other room; the ceiling was dingy and
discoloured between the great beams which traversed it,
and the floor was carpetless&mdash;little holes appearing
here and there in the boards close against the
wainscotting&mdash;to Mostyn's mind, unpleasantly suggestive
of rats.  A fine table occupied the centre of the
room, and upon this a white cloth had already been
spread.
</p>

<p>
"I've done my best about your dinner, sir,"
Willis said deprecatingly, "but I'm afraid, since I
had no notice of your coming, that there is not much
that I can do.  I don't understand cookin'&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," Mostyn laughed, "I can manage
with anything you've got, or can go down to the inn
for the matter of that."
</p>

<p>
Willis explained that he had brought up a cold
chicken and some accessories, also that Mr. Clithero
would find that there were bottles of good wine in the
cellar; if he could do with these.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn declared that he could do with these quite
well.  In fact, he would need nothing else that night,
and on the next day he could have a long chat with
Mrs. Willis and make all the necessary arrangements.
</p>

<p>
After this the bedrooms were explored, to reach
which it was necessary to pass along the gallery that
skirted the hall.  Of these only a couple were
furnished, all the other rooms being in a state of
deplorable decay.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Royce was always going to furnish the
house," Willis explained apologetically, "but when
he gave up racing he didn't seem to care to come
down any more.  He took the Grange because it is
near the training stables, you know, sir.  William
Treves has a big place just outside Partinborough."
</p>

<p>
The beds were made in both rooms; and Willis
explained that his wife had seen to this when she
heard that the Grange had passed into other hands,
and would probably be shortly occupied.  "She
has tidied up the place as well as she could," he
added.  "I hope you'll be all right and comfortable,
sir."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn glanced round the large airy room which
he had selected, and told himself that there was
every prospect of his comfort.  The room, indeed,
had not the appearance of having been long unoccupied,
and Mostyn noticed, somewhat to his surprise,
that the attentive Willis&mdash;or could it have been
Mrs. Willis?&mdash;had even been thoughtful enough to fill
the vases here, as in the drawing-room, with rich
and fresh rose-blooms.
</p>

<p>
"It's awfully nice to have these flowers," he
commented; "I must really congratulate you, Willis,
upon having arranged things so comfortably
for me."
</p>

<p>
A tinge of colour came into the gardener's sallow
face, and he turned away, as Mostyn thought, a little
nervously.
</p>

<p>
"You're very good, sir," was all he said.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn enjoyed his dinner, impromptu meal
though it was, nor did he neglect an excellent bottle
of claret that Willis produced from the cellar.  He
felt quite contented and happy, nor had he any sensation
of loneliness when, a little later, he heard the
dog-cart pass the front door and knew that Willis had
taken his departure.  Mostyn had told the gardener
that there was no need either for him or for his wife
to return that night.  Their cottage, he had learnt,
lay within the little park by which Partinborough
Grange was surrounded, some five or six minutes'
walk from the house.
</p>

<p>
After a while he amused himself by once more
exploring all the rooms on the ground floor, and then
he mounted to his bedroom, determined to unpack
and put everything straight for the night.  After
that he thought that it might be pleasant to have
a stroll amid the roses of the now moon-lit garden.
</p>

<p>
He found, however, that it took longer to put
things tidy than he had anticipated, and, furthermore,
he made one or two curious discoveries in the
room which he had determined to occupy.  There was
a large hanging cupboard, and here, very much to his
amusement, he came across some articles of feminine
apparel&mdash;a jacket, a cape, a straw hat, and sundry
other garments which he did not venture to examine
more closely.
</p>

<p>
"I think it must be true," he smiled to himself,
"that this room has not really been so long
unoccupied.  No doubt Mrs. Willis finds it more to her
taste than the cottage.  Or perhaps Mrs. Willis has
a daughter," he added, as he glanced critically at
the dainty straw hat and marked the juvenile cut of
the jacket.  "I really don't think that Mrs. Willis
can be the owner of these!"
</p>

<p>
A little later he found a hairpin lying on the floor,
and became still more convinced that his room must
have been occupied by some member of the Willis
household.  The fact troubled him, however, not at
all, and he laughed to himself as he recalled the
gardener's nervousness of manner when he had drawn
attention to the roses upon the mantelpiece.  "Whoever
has made herself at home here," he told himself,
"must at any rate have a nice idea of comfort and
the beauty of things.  I can make every allowance
for people who like flowers."
</p>

<p>
He was stooping over the portmanteau which he
was engaged in unpacking, and, at that moment, it
seemed to him that he heard a faint sound in the
house, as of the opening and shutting of a door.  He
raised himself to his knees and listened, but all was
still.
</p>

<p>
"I didn't think I was so imaginative," he muttered,
after a moment.  "I suppose that comes of being
alone in a half-furnished house&mdash;so far away from
everything, too."  He glanced round the room and
at the open window, which looked out upon the
lawn&mdash;a lawn intersected by dark shadows and silver
streaks of moonlight.  "It never struck me before,
either," he went on, "that there might be a ghost
at Partinborough Grange; it's just the place for one."  He
laughed at himself, not being in reality nervous,
and, if anything, rather enjoying the sense of his
isolation.  He decided that he would finish his
unpacking quickly, and then make his way to the
garden.  The night was soft and balmy, and the air
was fragrant with roses.  It would be better there
than in the house.
</p>

<p>
He bent himself once more to his task, throwing
out his belongings to either side of him in the careless
way of a man.  Then of a sudden, he paused, a pair of
shoes in one hand, a case of razors in the other, and
listened attentively.  Another moment and he had
dropped shoes and razors and started to his feet.
</p>

<p>
He did not know if he was afraid, though certainly
at the first moment a cold shiver had run down his
spine, and there had been a peculiar sensation as if
perspiration were about to break out on his brow.
He felt hot and cold at the same time, and yet he
was not conscious of any actual fear.
</p>

<p>
It was such a strange thing to be happening in
an empty house, and, at first, Mostyn had hardly
believed his ears.  But now there was no doubt about
it&mdash;someone was in the hall, and that someone was
playing the organ.
</p>

<p>
The sound had at first come so softly that it had
been really like a breath of wind stirring in the pipes;
Mostyn had thought that it must be something of the
sort, till he had remembered that there was practically
no wind that night.  Yet it was possible that
the sound was due to some perfectly natural cause
quite apart from human agency.
</p>

<p>
He listened with hazy ideas of the kind in his mind,
until it was evident that something like a tune&mdash;a
weird, dreamy tune, certainly, was being developed,
and that it was impossible to doubt any longer that
human fingers were touching the keys of the organ.
</p>

<p>
But who could it be?  Who could have broken in
and disturbed his privacy in so extraordinary a
manner?
</p>

<p>
Mostyn opened the door of his room and stole out
upon the balcony, moving as stealthily as he could,
anxious to see without being seen.  He did not feel
afraid&mdash;he was actuated by wonder and curiosity.
</p>

<p>
The great lamp that hung from the ceiling above
illuminated the hall.  Mostyn looked straight down
over the banisters at the mysterious player of the
organ.
</p>

<p>
It was a girl, and, as Mostyn recognised at once,
there was nothing ghostly or fantastic about her neat
and well-fitting coat and skirt, which were of some
light material.  Her head was averted, and she
seemed to be allowing her fingers to roam over the
keys half unconsciously, as though she were simply
giving way to her fancy.  She was wearing a hat, a
neat straw, not very dissimilar to the one which
Mostyn had found in his room, and it was evidently
she whom he had heard enter the house not very
long before.
</p>

<p>
Presently, as he stood there, silently staring at his
strange visitor, she turned her head, her attention
attracted perhaps by the light from the door which
Mostyn had left open behind him.
</p>

<p>
Their eyes met.  The girl gave a sharp scream
and started up, overthrowing the carved music
stool upon which she had been seated.  It was very
clear that the apparition of a man in the gallery was
as unexpected to her as was her appearance in the
hall to Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
And, simultaneously with her cry, an exclamation
of surprise and wonder escaped Mostyn also.  He
could not help himself.
</p>

<p>
"Rada, by all that's holy," he cried.  And then,
involuntarily, the girl's name came again to
his lips.  "Rada!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN ENTERTAINS A GUEST.
</h3>

<p>
For a few moments they stood, the man in the
gallery, the girl in the hall, staring at each other in
petrified astonishment.  Neither the one nor the
other seemed capable of moving.
</p>

<p>
It was the girl who recovered herself first and
broke the silence.  She was evidently possessed of
a fine spirit.  "Who are you?" she cried, her
voice faltering a little, but raised sufficiently for
him to distinguish what she said.  "Who are you,
and how dare you come here?"
</p>

<p>
This was good, considering that it was Mostyn's
own house, and the incongruity of the question
restored him to his normal power of reflection.  It
was Rada who was the trespasser, not he; there was
evidently a misunderstanding upon both sides, a
misunderstanding that must be explained away;
but it was very awkward that it should be Rada
Armitage of all persons in the world with whom he
must parley&mdash;Rada, his pet aversion.
</p>

<p>
He drew close to the banisters, leaning over so as
to make his voice quite audible; even to himself it
sounded hoarse and strained, echoing through the
emptiness of the house.  "My name is Mostyn
Clithero," he said, "and I have every right to be
here.  We have met before, Miss Armitage.  But
please wait, and I will come down to you."  He spoke
the last words rather hurriedly, having some fear in
his mind that she might run away, make her escape
by the front door before he could reach her side.
</p>

<p>
This, however, she did not seem at all disposed to
do.  Instead, she broke out into a soft laugh&mdash;a
laugh that was musical in tone, but which grated
upon Mostyn's ears, for it reminded him of her
attitude towards him upon Derby day.  She had
remembered him, then, as soon as he had
mentioned his name, and the recollection was one to
arouse her laughter.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn set his teeth firmly, and descended the
broken and rickety staircase with all the dignity
that he could muster.
</p>

<p>
Rada was still standing beside the organ.  She
had picked up the fallen music-stool and replaced
it in position.  She stood almost directly under
the over-hanging lamp, a lamp shaded in red,
which added its lustre to the rich colouring of her
face.  An unruly lock of black hair hung over
her forehead, and she was still smiling as Mostyn
approached her&mdash;smiling, her lips parted over a
row of white, even teeth.  She had quite recovered
her self-possession, whereas Mostyn felt that he
was trembling, partly with nervousness and partly
with indignation.
</p>

<p>
"I thought you were Willis, the gardener, when
I first saw you up there in the gallery, and had
got over my surprise.  You made me jump, you
know, because I imagined I was all alone in the
house."  She was quite taking command of the
situation.  "So you are Mr. Mostyn Clithero,"
she went on.  "I remember you quite well, though
what you are doing in Partinborough Grange at
this time of night is a mystery to me."
</p>

<p>
She had waited till Mostyn had reached the
bottom of the stairs before speaking; now she
seated herself upon the music-stool, leaning an elbow
upon a corner of the organ, staring Mostyn fully
in the face, with a great assumption of ease and
self-confidence.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps you will explain yourself," she added,
when he reached her side.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn felt himself in a ridiculous position.  It
was he who was being called upon to give an
explanation, and yet Rada Armitage was so
palpably the intruder, the one who should be
summoned to explain.
</p>

<p>
"I am here," he faltered, almost apologetically,
"because the house is mine, and I have to-day
come down from London to take possession of it."
</p>

<p>
"Partinborough Grange yours?"  Rada had
ceased to smile, but she was in no way disconcerted.
"How can that be?  The Grange belonged to
Mr. Royce.  He was no relation of yours, was he?"
</p>

<p>
"He left me the house by will," Mostyn explained;
"that is the simple truth.  And now, Miss
Armitage&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was about to ask her to account for her
presence, but she interrupted him sharply.  "And
how dared you call me by my Christian name just
now?  I don't think I have allowed you that
privilege!"
</p>

<p>
She did not speak as though she were annoyed.
In spite of the sharpness of her tone there was
a curious laughing light in her eyes, a half-mocking
expression, which Mostyn could not understand,
though he felt that he was blushing scarlet, and
was proportionately angry with himself.
</p>

<p>
Why should he have called her Rada?  Why
had he, ever since that day upon the coach, thought
of her by that name?  The word had escaped
him involuntarily, and no doubt the girl had every
right to be indignant.
</p>

<p>
"I beg your pardon," he said humbly.  "I must
apologise for that.  It was in the surprise of the
moment&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I see."  Her eyes were still sparkling, and she
was palpably enjoying Mostyn's discomfiture as
well as the whole situation.  She stretched out her
hand, a daintily-fashioned hand with small, cool
fingers.  "I'll forgive you, Mr. Clithero, and I
suppose it is I who must humbly ask your pardon
for my intrusion.  Awfully unconventional, isn't
it?  But I'm not a lady burglar come after the
silver&mdash;there is none, by the way&mdash;or anything of
that sort.  I'm quite a commonplace little person,
really."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn took the girl's hand in his and held it,
perhaps a little longer than he needed.  "You're
not commonplace," he faltered awkwardly; "you're
anything but that.  You're more like a sprite or
a pixie."
</p>

<p>
It was curious how she attracted him, and yet he
was quite sure she was mocking him all the time,
laughing at him in her heart.  He would have
liked to have refused her hand, to have spoken
formally, to have shown her that he was not the
sort of man to be made mock of: and yet all these
impulses were put aside by that extraordinary
fascination which she had over him, and for which
he could not account, the fascination which had
made him think of her so often during the last
week, and which had brought her Christian name to
his lips in the first moment of surprise.  He was
sure that he hated her&mdash;and yet he had held her
hand longer than he need have done, and perhaps
with firmer grip than was necessary.
</p>

<p>
The worst of it was that Rada seemed to understand
this, to have the knowledge of her power:
she would only laugh at him all the more.
</p>

<p>
"Call me a mischievous imp," she retorted,
brushing back the recalcitrant curl, "if that's
what you mean.  Don't be shy, Mr. Clithero.
After that I'll explain why I'm here, and then go."
</p>

<p>
Of course she must go.  What else could be
suggested?  That is what Mostyn thought, yet
when he came to speak he gave expression to a very
different sentiment.  "I&mdash;I'm sure I don't know
why you are here, Miss Armitage," he faltered;
"but if you really meant to stay&mdash;well, I can
clear out, you know, for to-night anyway.  I believe
there's an inn at Partinborough."
</p>

<p>
She laughed musically.  "Well, we'll see.  But
let's go into the drawing-room to talk: it's more
cosy there, and I can make myself comfortable in
my favourite chair.  This hall's always full of
shadows, and we look like a pair of ghosts.  Then
there are the roses in the drawing-room that I put
there myself this morning."  She spoke as though
she were the hostess, and with complete
self-possession.  It was she who led the way and Mostyn
who followed, still bewildered, and at war with
himself.
</p>

<p>
So there was no doubt about it now; it was
Rada who had filled those vases with flowers, and
who had evidently occupied the room which he
had selected for his own.  But why on earth had
Willis not given some explanation?
</p>

<p>
They entered the drawing-room, and Rada
installed herself in one of the comfortable
chintz-covered arm chairs.  She was seated with her
back to the unshuttered window, through which
the moon, fully risen by now, could be seen riding
in a cloudless and star-sprinkled sky.  At that
moment a rumble of carriage wheels made itself
heard along the drive.
</p>

<p>
"What's that?" queried Rada, looking round
sharply.
</p>

<p>
"It's the Willis's driving back to their cottage,"
said Mostyn shortly.  "Their son met with an
accident, and they had to bring him home.  Since
you seem to be a regular visitor here, Miss Armitage,
I cannot understand why Willis said nothing to
me about you."  As he spoke the dog-cart with
its three occupants passed the window and
disappeared, the noise of wheels gradually dying
away in the distance.
</p>

<p>
"I am never here for more than one night at
a time," explained Rada, "and I suppose, since
I slept here last night, that Mr. Willis did not
expect me to turn up again.  I was about the
garden all the morning, and wondered what had
become of him.  I put the roses in the vases, but
I suppose he thought they were yesterday's."
</p>

<p>
"I see."  Mostyn slowly nodded his head.  He
had seated himself facing the girl, and he could not
withdraw his eyes from her face.  How bewitchingly
elf-like she looked, as she sat there with the light
of the moon shining upon her&mdash;for the room was
but dimly lit by the shaded lamps at the far end.
Yes, elf-like was the word, or perhaps Rada was
even more correct in describing herself as an imp.
She had taken off her flower-bedecked hat, and her
black, glistening curls framed a face that seemed
to glow with life and mischief.
</p>

<p>
"It's all very simple," she went on.  "You see,
Mr. Clithero, we live, my father and I, not very
far from here.  It's only a couple of miles across
the fields, though a bit longer by road.  Barton
Mill is the name of the place; it was once the old
mill-house, but the mill's been disused for years.
We are not well off, and my father got the house
for next to nothing."
</p>

<p>
Rada bit her lip, as though her explanation was
not as easy as she had thought, then continued:
"My father's a queer-tempered man, and I suppose
I'm rather an impossible person myself at times.
We are apt to have little quarrels."  She flushed
slightly, a very unusual thing with Rada, as she
made the admission.  "When there's any little
difference between us," she went on, "I run away,
and instal myself here for twenty-four hours or so;
then, when I go home things are all right again.
I'm great friends with Mr. and Mrs. Willis, and
they are accustomed to have me about the place."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, from his own experience with Captain
Armitage, could easily appreciate the discomforts
of the girl's home.  Rada's father was a drunkard&mdash;there
was no other word for it&mdash;and it was easy
to imagine that there were times when he would
become quite unbearable: it stood to reason that
the girl must sometimes have a hard time of it.
</p>

<p>
"I'm quite a wild creature when I'm in the
country, you see, Mr. Clithero," Rada resumed;
"not at all the same girl whom you saw in London
playing at gentility."  She was speaking earnestly
now, the mockery of her manner put aside.  This
was an extraordinary characteristic of Rada's,
and one that Mostyn had already noticed.  She
would pass quickly from mood to mood; she was
just as capricious as an April day.
</p>

<p>
She sighed, and glanced round the room.  "I
have almost come to look upon everything here as
my own," she said, "and I shall feel having to be
shut out in the future."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn leant forward, speaking eagerly, and
again expressing himself with words that he had
no intention of saying.  "I hope you will come
here as often as you like, Miss Armitage.  I am
glad to know that we are such near neighbours.
I shall probably live here, because I want to be
near the training stables.  I am going in for
racing," he added impulsively.
</p>

<p>
Once more she broke out into musical laughter,
laughter which had the ring of derision in it.
Mostyn drew himself up stiffly; the momentary
spell which had fallen upon him was broken.
</p>

<p>
"You are going in for racing, Mr. Clithero&mdash;you!"  There
was painful emphasis upon the
pronoun.  "Do you mean to say that you've taken
up my challenge of the other day seriously?  You
are going to win the Derby in five years' time?
Forgive me laughing, but really, I'm only a girl,
but I'll back myself to win the Derby before you,
and with some hope of success."
</p>

<p>
She spoke without measuring her words, and
perhaps without the intention of giving offence.
"Are you going to enter a horse for the Waterloo
Cup too?" she queried; this amid peals of soft
but impudent laughter.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn drew himself up, but the worst of it
was, that in the presence of this girl, he could make
such a poor show of dignity.  He could not even
restrain himself from that absurd habit of blushing.
"I made a fool of myself that day, I know," he
said heatedly, "but it isn't generous of you to
recall it; it isn't as if you knew all the
circumstances&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"  He broke off suddenly, staring fixedly at
the window before him.
</p>

<p>
Rada saw that her words had stung and wounded.
She was not spiteful at heart, though despite
herself her tongue would run away with her.  She
had no dislike for Mostyn; on the contrary, she
had told herself that day upon the coach that he
was quite a good-looking boy, and that she would
have preferred his company to that of young
Caldershot, who was, after all, nothing but an
empty-headed fop, whose conversation was all
about himself.  Rada had quite decided in her
own mind that Mostyn was to be her cavalier that
day, and she had been more than a little piqued at
his lack of attention, which perhaps accounted for
the snubbing he had received.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be cross," she began, a little
conscience-stricken.  "I didn't mean&mdash;&mdash;"  Suddenly she
realised the fixity of his gaze upon the window.
"What are you staring at?" she asked, turning
her head and following the direction of his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn sprang from his chair, and without
answering her strode across to the window, throwing
it open, and gazing out into the night.  He had
imagined, just as he was replying to Rada, that he
had caught sight of a face, the face of a man,
staring in at the window&mdash;a face flattened against
the glass, appearing through it distorted, malignant,
and hideous.
</p>

<p>
He had been so occupied with his own sense of
wrong that it had been a few moments before he
had actually realised the face.  The ivy and creepers
grew thick about the window, and as he stared
vacantly he had thought that what he saw was
merely due to the peculiar form taken by an
overhanging spray of ivy.  But, as he looked, the face
had taken shape; he had seen a pair of glistening
eyes, a flattened nose and an ugly, grinning mouth.
It was then that he sprang up and made his sudden
dart to the window.
</p>

<p>
But when he opened it and stepped out upon
the soft grass there was no one to be seen.  He
looked up and down the road; he took a few steps
in either direction, then told himself that he must
have been deceived: it was the ivy, after all, which
had caused the delusion.  He stepped back into
the drawing-room, closing the window after him
and attempting to put up the shutters, which had
evidently not been touched for years.
</p>

<p>
"What was it?" asked Rada, who had risen
and was standing by his side.
</p>

<p>
He told her.  "I thought I saw a face&mdash;the
face of a man," he said.
</p>

<p>
"What was he like?" Rada looked concerned,
almost frightened.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know; I can't describe him, for the
face was contorted by the glass.  But it was all
an absurd mistake of mine, and there wasn't
anything there really, but just the ivy."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder."  Rada's voice shook.  "This is
a lonely place."  She glanced at a little gold watch
which she wore.  "It is nearly ten o'clock," she
went on nervously, "and we have been sitting
here talking without making up our minds what
we are going to do."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go to the inn," Mostyn said; then he
glanced doubtfully at the girl, "though I don't
think it's right that you should stay in a lonely
house like this all by yourself," he added.
</p>

<p>
"I've done so many times before."  The girl
spoke with some defiance; then her eyes turned
nervously in the direction of the window, before
which Mostyn was vainly struggling to fix the
shutters.  "But I don't know that I care to
to-night," she added, the look of challenge fading
from her eyes with one of those rapid changes
peculiar to her.  "I&mdash;I think I'm frightened."
</p>

<p>
Indeed she looked frightened, more frightened,
perhaps, than the occasion demanded, and it was
quite useless for Mostyn to try and argue that
what he had seen was in reality nothing more than
a cluster of ivy.
</p>

<p>
"You must walk with me to the Willis's
cottage," she said.  "We know that they have
returned, and I shall be quite safe there."  Her
eyes were timorous, and she trembled as she stood
by his side.  It was as though she was conscious
of some personal danger, of a threat, a menace, to
herself.  All Mostyn's anger faded away.
</p>

<p>
And so it was arranged.  Rada was restless and
nervous, unable to talk on any topic whatever,
quite incapable of listening to the explanation
which Mostyn had desired to make as to his taking
up racing.  He would have liked to have told her,
too, about Castor, and the offer which had been
made to him by Captain Armitage.  It seemed
only fair to do so, for he had an idea that she
might not approve of the captain's decision to sell
his horse.  Not that Mostyn would allow this to
affect him, so he told himself.  He had been
challenged by Rada to a sort of contest, a challenge
repeated that day, and he could use any tactics he
chose, as long as they were straight and above-board.
</p>

<p>
But she gave him no opportunity to speak.
She hurried him down the broad drive, a road
which was as yet strange to him, and which, like
the one that he had already traversed, skirted the
lawn and then plunged into the wood, leading
direct to the Willis's cottage, which was on the
further boundary of the estate.
</p>

<p>
As they stepped rapidly among the trees, she
kept turning her head to the right and the left.
"What's that?" she would say, and then, gripping
his arm with real alarm, "I'm sure I heard footsteps
following us; there's someone hiding in the
wood!"
</p>

<p>
Perhaps Mostyn caught the infection of her
nervousness; at any rate, there were moments
when he, too, heard, or imagined he heard, the
sound of the cracking of dry wood, as if the twigs
were being broken under a heavy heel.  Once he
halted and cried out, "Who's there?" but there
was no reply, and he comforted his trembling
little companion with the assurance that they
were both in safety.
</p>

<p>
It was he who was self-possessed now, for they
stood in a different relation to each other.  He
was the man, and Rada was just a sensitive,
frightened girl, who needed his support and
protection.  That walk through the wood, small event
as it was, was not without its effect upon Mostyn's
subsequent relations with Rada.
</p>

<p>
Whether they were being followed or not, they
reached the gardener's cottage in safety, and
presently the door was opened to them by
Mrs. Willis herself, a homely, comfortable woman with
an engaging smile.
</p>

<p>
Rada quickly explained her wish to stay at the
cottage; then she turned to Mostyn, and once more
extended her hand.  "Thank you for bringing
me," she murmured, "and if I said things to make
you cross, please forgive me."  She was altogether
charming at that moment, and once more the
touch of her fingers sent a thrill through Mostyn's
whole being.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I see you to-morrow?" he asked hastily.
</p>

<p>
"I don't know."  She shrugged her shoulders.
"I may go back home, I may not; I always act on
impulse."  She was smiling now, secure in the
company of the gardener's wife.  Presently, with
a nod and a smile, she disappeared into the cottage,
and Mostyn was left to make his way back to the
Grange alone.
</p>

<p>
This time there was no sound in the wood on
either side of him, and he was quite certain that
his footsteps were not dogged.  It must have
been imagination, after all.
</p>

<p>
He thought of Rada as he walked.  "What
a witch she is," he muttered, "and how she
fascinates me!  Do I hate her, I wonder, or&mdash;&mdash;"  He
did not finish the phrase, perhaps because he
could not answer the question.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN MAKES A PURCHASE.
</h3>

<p>
At an unreasonably early hour the next morning
Mostyn, who had slept peacefully enough in his
new quarters, was aroused by the advent of Willis,
the gardener.  The latter, as on the day before,
seemed concerned as to the reception which might
be offered him.  He rubbed his lantern jaws
nervously with a work-hardened forefinger while he
informed Mostyn that it was a fine day, and that
he had brought up the hot water for shaving.
</p>

<p>
"How's the boy?" asked Mostyn, stretching
himself and yawning, but half awake.
</p>

<p>
"Nicely, thank you, sir."  Willis drew a breath
of relief.  No doubt he had expected to be taken
severely to task for not having revealed to his
master the fact of Rada Armitage's frequent
occupation of the Grange, a trespass which he had
palpably condoned.  "Miss Rada's been very good
to him, pore lad, and is goin' to send him some
books to read.  Reads a treat, does our Jim."  Willis
spoke Miss Armitage's name as though to
give the necessary opening for explanations.  And
these were immediately demanded by Mostyn, who
woke up completely at the mention of the girl's
name.
</p>

<p>
The explanation was as Rada had hinted.  Her
appearance had not been looked for since she had
slept at the Grange the night before, and had never
yet spent two consecutive nights there.  Willis
meant to have taken the earliest opportunity of
warning her that the Grange was no longer
unoccupied; he had thought it would not be necessary
to mention the matter to Mr. Clithero at all.  As
for the clothes in the cupboard, he had quite
forgotten all about them, and he had thought that
the roses in the vases had been left from overnight.
He was very penitent, as was his wife, and they
both hoped the matter would be overlooked.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn took it all as a joke, much to the gardener's
relief.  It was a perfect June morning: the sun
shone in at the latticed window, bearing the scent
of roses and jasmine, and he felt that he had
awakened to a new day, a new life.  How different
this was to his dingy London lodgings!  How
different, even, to the pretentious gloom of his
father's house!  Yet everything about him was
his own, absolutely his own!  The blood coursed
quickly through his veins.  How could he be angry
with Willis?
</p>

<p>
Mostyn proceeded to put some questions as to
Rada.  The girl's name came glibly to his lips.
A desire had come upon him, born, no doubt,
partly of that strange fascination which she exerted
and partly of the revelation of his own masculine
power which had followed her fear of an indefinite
danger, to master the little vixen, as he mentally
described her, to curb and break her in as an
untrained filly&mdash;he was already beginning to use
sporting metaphor, even to himself.
</p>

<p>
But Willis, who appeared very ready to discuss
Rada, almost took Mostyn's breath away by his
first statement.
</p>

<p>
"She's a hangel!" he said emphatically.
</p>

<p>
"A what?"  Mostyn had regarded Rada in
anything but an angelic light.
</p>

<p>
"A hangel," repeated the gardener, laying great
stress on the aspirate.  He proceeded to sing
Rada's praises with evident enjoyment, and palpably
from a sense of conviction.  She was, it appeared,
although as poor as a church mouse, the Lady
Bountiful to all the cottage folk in the
neighbourhood, by whom she was simply adored.  She
would minister comforts to the sick and needy,
often little more than a cheerful word and the
sunlight of her presence, but no less welcome for
all that.  She would take charge of unruly children
and attend to the house-keeping in the unavoidable
absence of the mother; she would cook little
dainties with her own hands; she had an extraordinary
capacity for lulling restless babies to
sleep.  Willis declared stoutly that she had pulled
his own little daughter through a fever when the
doctor had been despondent, and she was not
afraid of infection either, he added proudly.
</p>

<p>
Here, indeed, was Rada in a new light!  What
a queer and complex little creature she must be!
She had treated him with such shocking rudeness:
he had thought her the very contrary to the
"hangel" described by Willis, but now it was
evident that there were depths in the girl's nature
which had not yet been revealed to him.
</p>

<p>
Having praised Rada to the full, Willis proceeded
to abuse her father, and that in no measured terms.
He was a shiftless, idle ne'er-do-well, who had lost
all pretensions to being considered a gentleman,
though up in London, Willis had heard, he did
play the "high and mighty."  He went about to
race meetings when he could, and had sometimes
been away for days without leaving provision for
his daughter.  He kept one or two race-horses at
Treves's stables, but had not brought off a win
for some time past.  When at home he lounged
about in his shirt-sleeves, read the sporting papers,
and drank himself silly.  Rada, very naturally,
found her own distractions, and her chief joy was
to career about the country upon her black mare,
Bess, a creature as wild as herself.
</p>

<p>
"The captain don't take no stock of his girl,"
said Willis emphatically, "an' he'll be sorry for
it one of these days.  I see her about with young
Jack Treves more'n enough, an' Jack ain't the
right sort for her, not by a long way."
</p>

<p>
This was a revelation at which Mostyn felt
vaguely annoyed.  He took an immediate dislike
to Jack Treves.  Yet why should he worry himself
over Rada's flirtations?
</p>

<p>
Later that morning, while he ate a comfortable
breakfast served up by Mrs. Willis, he heard all
the gardener's ideas recapitulated by the good
woman.  She was just as emphatic on the subject
of the captain as her husband had been, nor did
she swerve from her opinion when she learnt that
Mostyn was already acquainted with the Armitages,
though the knowledge of this fact reduced Willis
to awkward silence and to much rubbing of his jaw.
</p>

<p>
Rada, it appeared, had left the cottage early
that morning, probably, Mrs. Willis opined, to
return home, though it was quite possible she
might have gone to other friends.  Captain Armitage
had been on the drink, and was best left alone.
</p>

<p>
After an hour or so spent in surveying his new
domain, and in discussing plans for the future
with the Willis's, Mostyn set out to pay a visit
at Barton Mill House.  Captain Armitage might
be in an objectionably bibulous condition, but
Mostyn was not afraid of meeting him.
</p>

<p>
Of course, he told himself that he wanted to
discuss the matter of Castor, and that there was
really no time for delay; also that Captain Armitage
might very well introduce him to the trainer,
William Treves; all of which was good and plausible,
but it was neither of the horse Castor nor of the
trainer that Mostyn thought, as with some difficulty
he found his way through the narrow lanes to
Mill House: his reflections were concentrated upon
Rada.
</p>

<p>
He found Captain Armitage at home, but to his
great disappointment Rada was not at the Mill
House, nor had Captain Armitage the smallest
idea where she had gone to.  He didn't seem to
mind.  He laughed immoderately when he heard
the story of the rencontre at the Grange the night
before, and conjectured that Rada must have
gone off to stay with some friends of hers, some
folk who were accustomed to her erratic ways,
and who lived in the neighbourhood of Newmarket.
She had turned up at the Mill House, it appeared,
quite early in the morning, had selected some
books from her little library, had had Bess saddled,
and had then ridden off.  Captain Armitage had
not seen her because he was in bed.
</p>

<p>
"We don't always hit it off together," he
explained jerkily, "and Rada's quite capable of
taking care of herself.  She is a little devil, but
I like her spirit."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn found it difficult to reconcile the divergent
views of his gardener and of Captain Armitage as
to Rada's character, but he did not feel called upon
to make any comment upon the subject.  Personally
he was inclined to agree with the captain.
</p>

<p>
Of course Captain Armitage was very surprised
to receive a visit from Mostyn, and he broke off
into a volley of oaths when he learned that the
latter had profited under the will of Anthony
Royce; this, though Mostyn did not give the full
particulars as to his strange bequest, seeing no reason
why he should do so, but merely mentioned that
he had inherited the Grange and a certain sum of
money as well.
</p>

<p>
"He never left me a penny, not a brass
farthing," said Captain Armitage solemnly, "yet
I was one of his oldest friends, a school-fellow and
all the rest of it."  This was a lie, and Mostyn
knew it to be a lie, but the matter was not worth
discussing.
</p>

<p>
The captain did not present an imposing figure
that morning.  Mostyn found him lounging in
a disreputably worn arm-chair, clad in a soiled
but brilliantly-flowered dressing-gown, smoking an
old meerschaum pipe, and perusing a sporting paper.
His white hair was untidy, his beard unkempt,
and his slippers down at the heel.  The little
sitting-room was dingy and uncared for; Rada
had evidently abandoned the hopeless task of
tidying it.
</p>

<p>
"I told you that I was a poor man, Mr. Clithero,"
Captain Armitage said, waving a deprecating hand
round the room, "and now you can see for
yourself."  Suddenly his dull eyes brightened.  "You
say Royce has left you some brass," he insinuated.
"Have you thought better of that offer I made
you the other day?"
</p>

<p>
"That's what I'm here for," explained Mostyn.
"Are you still willing to sell Castor, Captain
Armitage?"
</p>

<p>
"I should say I was, my boy."  The old man
sprang from his chair with something of the nervous
energy that Mostyn remembered he had displayed
when on the coach.  "Fifteen hundred pounds!
Why, it would be the making of me just now."  He
spoke eagerly.  "I know how I could turn it into
five, into ten thousand.  There's Cardigan, a sure
thing for the Liverpool Cup, and Boscowen, a
perfect snip at Sandown.  Give me fifteen hundred
down, and I'll make a fortune.  You shall have the
tips, too; I'll throw them into the bargain."
</p>

<p>
So it came about that, without loss of time,
Captain Armitage, muttering and mumbling to
himself, had shuffled out of the room, leaving
Mostyn to gaze out of the uncleaned window over
a strip of garden where the grass grew rank, and
where weeds choked the few hardy flowers that
had endured.  Whatever she might be elsewhere,
Rada evidently took no pride in her own home;
Mostyn told himself that the Mill House, practically
little more than a tumble-down cottage, was one
of the most dreary spots he had ever visited.
</p>

<p>
It was not long before the captain reappeared,
a little more spruce in his attire and ready to go
out.  It was, it appeared, not more than half an
hour's walk to the training stables, and there was
no reason why the bargain should not be clinched
at once.
</p>

<p>
This was all very well, but Mostyn did not feel
capable of relying upon his own judgment, nor
did he trust Captain Armitage's word.  Fifteen
hundred pounds was a large sum, and not to be
merely thrown away to put cash into the pocket
of a drunkard.  Would he do well to purchase
Castor?  Certainly Sir Roderick had admitted the
value of the colt.  That went for a good deal, but
at the bottom of his heart Mostyn knew that his
desire to own the horse had something to do with
the struggle which he felt, in an indefinite sort of
way, had commenced between himself and Rada.
"I'm a girl, but I'll back myself to win a Derby
before you!" she had cried contemptuously, and
the words had galled and stung him.  She had
great faith in Castor, he knew that; well, it would
be a fitting punishment upon her if, by extraordinary
luck, he contrived to carry off the race
with that particular horse.  Mostyn was not
spiteful by nature, but he was very human.
</p>

<p>
As they walked together, passing through the
little town and then emerging upon open country,
Captain Armitage exerted his powers of persuasion
to the full, and he had a plausible tongue.  Mostyn
had an eye for a horse, so the old man asserted,
and he had recognised that fact upon Derby day,
or he would not have dreamed of making his offer.
He had taken a fancy to Mostyn from the first,
especially because the latter had taken his joking
in good part.  What he was doing was purely out
of personal consideration.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Clithero,"&mdash;he halted in that sudden
and abrupt manner peculiar to him, and seized
the young man by the arm&mdash;"we don't want a lot
of palaver over this business.  Treves will tell
you that the colt's all right, and his word's as good
as gospel.  Settle on the nail and we'll cry quits
at a thousand."
</p>

<p>
They reached the training stables at last, a low
narrow building, lying a little back from the road,
a building that formed three sides of a square and
was approached by a large gate.  Beyond it, and
indeed, on either side of the road, was open level
country.  "A capital pitch for exercising," as
Captain Armitage put it, pointing to a row of horses
that were following one another in steady line
over the down.
</p>

<p>
Castor had just returned from exercise, and
they found him in his stable where he had been
groomed by one of the boys.  William Treves
himself, an important personality, a man who
had accumulated a considerable fortune, but who
had no pride about him, and who was not ashamed
of his humble origin, nor of the fact that he had
never acquired a mastery of the king's English,
discoursed volubly on the perfections of the colt.
Apparently he already knew of Captain Armitage's
desire to find a purchaser.  The man gave Mostyn
the impression of honesty.
</p>

<p>
As for Castor, little as Mostyn knew of horses
he was impressed by the animal's appearance.
Stripped of his clothes, he appeared a black colt
of such magnificent proportions as to give one the
idea that he was a three-year-old, instead of a
nursery youngster.
</p>

<p>
After much talking, in which Mostyn took small
part, the bargain was struck.  In return for his
cheque for a thousand pounds, Mostyn became
the proprietor of "as fine an 'oss as the eye of man
could look upon;" so William Treves put it.
</p>

<p>
"'E 'as a terrific turn of speed," the trainer
continued, "and there isn't a three-year-old in
this country that can 'old 'im at a mile at weight
for age.  I borrowed a couple of Colonel Turner's
youngsters the other day to try 'im with, an' 'e
left 'em fairly standing still, and the Colonel's 'ed
man went 'ome with a wonderful tale about 'em,
although 'e didn't know I'd put an extra five pound
on Castor.  Take my advice, if you're set on
winnin' next year's Derby, don't pull 'im out too
often this year.  'E's entered for the Eclipse at
Sandown and the National Produce Breeders'
Stakes, and you might let 'im run about four times
just to give 'im a breather and get 'im used to
racecourse crowds.  No man livin' can say to-day
wot will win the Derby next year, but if 'e trains
on and puts on more bone, as I expect 'e will, 'e
must stand a grand chance."
</p>

<p>
"You hear that?  He'll win the Derby for
you."  Armitage smote his young friend heartily
on the back as he spoke.  "Take my word for it."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was content with his purchase, proud
of himself.  There was but one hitch, and that
occurred later in the morning when Armitage and
Treves had moved away to inspect a new arrival
at the stables, leaving Mostyn standing alone,
a little awkwardly, in the great square yard.
</p>

<p>
A young man approached him, a tall, broad-shouldered
youth, good-looking after a coarse and
vulgar style.  He was aggressively horsey in his
attire, and wore a cap set at the back of his head,
displaying sleek hair plastered down over his
forehead.  This, as Mostyn was subsequently to learn,
was Jack Treves, the son of the trainer.  He had
a familiar way of speaking, and made use of slang
which jarred at once upon Mostyn's ears.
</p>

<p>
He began by making a few casual remarks, then
he jerked his head in the direction of his father
and of Captain Armitage.  "I hear you've bought
Castor," he said.  "A fine horse, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Mostyn, "I've bought the colt."
</p>

<p>
"Well, it may be all right."  Jack Treves shook
his head doubtfully.  "And of course the captain
can do what he likes with his own&mdash;that is, if it is
his own&mdash;but I'll bet there'll be ructions, for
Castor's entered for the Derby in the name of Miss
Armitage, and she's always looked upon him as
her particular property."  He stooped and picked
up a wisp of straw, passing it between his fingers.
</p>

<p>
"Her property?" faltered Mostyn.  "I don't
understand."
</p>

<p>
Jack Treves nibbled at his straw.  "The captain
didn't tell you then?  I thought not.  You see,
when he went broke three years ago and appeared
in the forfeit list at Weatherby's, she sold all her
mother's jewels and paid his debts, and it was
then that she registered her colours&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Her</i> colours!" gasped Mostyn.  "Do you
mean to tell me that Rada&mdash;er, Miss Armitage&mdash;has
registered racing colours?"
</p>

<p>
"Lor lummy, yes!" was the reply, spoken with
a certain malice.  "A bit young, of course, but
she's not like other girls.  She's not had the best
of luck, though, up to date, and that's why she's
so keen on seeing the lemon and lavender carried
to victory at Epsom next year.  She simply dotes
on Castor, and considers that the colt is hers in
return for that jewellery."
</p>

<p>
Jack Treves threw his whittled straw away.
"I guess," he said, "there'll be the devil of a row."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN LEARNS HIS ERROR.
</h3>

<p>
Some seven or eight days after the sale of Castor,
Captain Armitage reclined at his ease in the
dilapidated arm-chair which he particularly affected.
He had grown to like the untidiness and the dirt
of his dismal little sitting-room, and he would not
have altered his immediate surroundings for
anything better, even had he been able to do so.
</p>

<p>
It was about nine o'clock at night.  He had
partaken of a meagre supper&mdash;he never ate much at
the best of times&mdash;served up in haphazard fashion
by the one wretched serving maid, a poor little slut,
who did the whole work of the house.  The plates
and dishes had not been cleared away but were piled
up anyhow on a clothless table by his side, and within
easy reach of his hand was a bottle of champagne,
three parts empty, with which he had been regaling
himself.  Close by, too, was another bottle which
contained brandy; Captain Armitage was very fond
of champagne, only he used to say that he preferred
it diluted&mdash;but he was accustomed to dilute it with
brandy instead of water.
</p>

<p>
He had returned from London the day before,
where he had had what he would himself have called
"a good time" upon the proceeds of Mostyn's cheque
for a thousand pounds.  What had become of the
money and how much remained over was a secret
only known to Captain Armitage; at any rate, to
judge by his complacent smile, the smile of a man
who was three parts intoxicated&mdash;he was not suffering
from any pricking of conscience for having disposed
of property which did not actually belong to
him.  He knew that there would be an unpleasant
scene when Rada returned, and there were times
when he was a little afraid of his petulant, self-willed
daughter; but Captain Armitage was the kind of
man who lived in the present, and did not
unnecessarily worry himself about what might come
to pass in the future.  He had had his thousand
pounds, and that, after all, was the great point.
</p>

<p>
He had been obliged to tell a lie or so, but that
was a matter of very minor importance.  He had
explained to Mostyn, who had come to him hot with
excitement, and dragging young Treves in his wake,
to demand an explanation, that it was by Rada's own
wish and permission that he had sold the horse.
This was the same tale that he had spun for the
benefit of old Treves when the idea of raising money
upon his daughter's property had first occurred to
him.  Mostyn had been silenced, but the ominous
giggle which had followed him when he turned
away was by no means reassuring.  He had felt a
strange desire to turn back and punch Jack Treves's
head, all the more so since the latter had spoken of
Rada in a familiar manner, which he resented; but
he had restrained himself for the sake of his
dignity.
</p>

<p>
In the days which followed Mostyn had worried
Rada's father not a little.  He had wanted the girl's
address in order that he might write to her, but this
Captain Armitage had professed himself quite unable
to supply.  The girl came and went as she chose, he
didn't worry his head about her.  She was all right
with her Newmarket friends&mdash;but he couldn't even
remember their name.  Finally Captain Armitage
departed for London, and then Mostyn hung day
after day about Barton Mill House keeping watch for
the girl's return.  He felt certain that her father had
made no provision for her if she arrived home before
he did.  Very often Mostyn called himself a fool
for his pains, for what, after all, was Rada to him?
It was all very well to tell himself that he wanted
confirmation of her father's story about Castor from
her lips&mdash;that was true enough, but he wanted more
besides, and knew it.  It was the magnetic thrill
of his whole being induced by her presence that he
desired, and, though he could not account for it, the
feeling was there and had to be recognised.
</p>

<p>
Captain Armitage, alone in his dingy sitting-room,
had just drained his glass, crossed his slippered feet,
which were stretched out upon a second chair,
dropped a stump of his cigar&mdash;it had been a fine
cigar&mdash;one of a highly-priced box that he had brought
back with him from London&mdash;and closed his heavy
lids, preparatory to slumber, when Rada herself
swept into the room.
</p>

<p>
She came in like an avalanche, slamming the door
behind her; for a moment she stood contemptuously
regarding the semi-intoxicated man, then she
unceremoniously aroused him to full consciousness of
her presence by jerking away the chair upon which
his feet reclined.  Captain Armitage sat up
grumbling and rubbing his heavy eyes.
</p>

<p>
The girl stood before him, indignation plainly
written on every feature.  "Father, you've sold
Castor!" she cried.  "I met Jack Treves not half
an hour ago, and he told me.  It's the truth, I
suppose?"
</p>

<p>
The man gazed at her vacantly.  He had not
expected to see his daughter that night, and he was
not prepared with any explanation.  Weakly he
tried to turn the tables.  "Where have you been?"
he asked, plaintively, "leaving your poor old father
all alone like this&mdash;&mdash;"  She deigned no reply.  He
knew where she had been.
</p>

<p>
"It's the truth, I suppose?" she repeated.  "I
want to hear it from your own lips."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you see, my dear," he began, "we are
very poor&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Is it true?" Rada's lips were compressed
together; she was drawing long deep breaths.
</p>

<p>
He went on mumbling.  "We must live.  I had
debts.  They had to be paid somehow.  A thousand
pounds&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So it is true.  You've sold Castor for a thousand
pounds!  You pretended that you were doing it
with my permission.  Oh father! oh father!"
</p>

<p>
Her mood changed with its usual lightning
velocity.  Her eyes were brimming over with tears.
Her father was the one man with whom she always
sought to hold her temper in sway.  It was the
instinct of a lifetime.  Pitiful, degrading object as he
was, long ago as she had given up all hope of effecting
any reformation in him, of making him, at least,
clean, and manly, and wholesome, he was yet her
father, and she had lived with him ever since the
death of her mother when she was little more than a
child.  His deterioration had been gradual; she had
fought and struggled against it.  She had taken upon
herself responsibilities unsuited to a girl of her age,
but all her efforts had been in vain.  She despised the
degraded old man, and that because she saw him with
no prejudiced eyes, she saw him for what he was, but
at the same time&mdash;he was her father.
</p>

<p>
Regardless of his protests she began to clear away
the bottles from the table; she did so by force of
habit, though she knew quite well that as soon as her
back was turned he would be after them again; there
had been times, however, when he had not allowed
her to exercise even this authority, when he had
stormed in violent fashion, when he had even struck
her.  On this occasion, however, he ventured nothing
more than a feeble protest, lolling back in his chair,
smiling foolishly.
</p>

<p>
"A thousand pounds, my dear, think of it!" he
muttered with a drunken chuckle, "think of it!
Needs must when the devil drives, you know, and
he's been driving at me, goading at me&mdash;oh, yes! an
ugly devil, and a lot of little imps besides.  They
wanted gold, and they've got it.  But we're going
to make our fortunes," he went on, in maddening
sing-song monotone, "for there's enough left to
back our luck at Sandown and Ascot.  That's what
I had in mind, my dear.  A quick fortune&mdash;cash in
hand in a week or so&mdash;not to wait a whole year for
the Derby, and then perhaps come down.  There's
Pollux, remember&mdash;old Rory's Pollux."  His head
lolled over to one side, and he spoke sleepily.
"Besides, young Clithero will give you the colt
back when he knows the truth&mdash;it's ten to one on
that.  It'll be all right for you, my dear, and you
needn't worry about me."
</p>

<p>
"Listen to me, father," said Rada, biting her lip
to restrain an outburst of anger and disgust at the
meanness, the vileness of the whole thing.  Her
father had calculated upon Mostyn Clithero giving
her back her horse when he found out how he
had been defrauded.  He did not mind what might
be thought of himself&mdash;he had had his thousand
pounds.  She dashed her tears away, and stood up
by the cupboard before which she had been stooping,
attempting to hide the bottles away.  "Listen to
me," she went on, "try to understand me if you
can.  Castor was my horse.  You gave him to me
when he was foaled.  Now he has a big chance for
the Derby.  He was entered in my name.  I was
his registered proprietor&mdash;he was to be ridden in
my colours.  All my dreams were of Castor; I would
sit building castles in the air by the hour together.
It brought colour into my life and made me glad to
live.  You don't know what it has been to me;
you cannot understand how I delighted in watching
Castor at his gallops, whispering to myself, 'The
horse is mine&mdash;mine&mdash;and in two years' time&mdash;in
eighteen months' time&mdash;in fifteen months' time&mdash;I
shall watch my horse winning the big race!'&mdash;that's
how I used to go on; I counted the months,
the days, even the hours.  All my pride was centred
in Castor; and you have sold him&mdash;sold him for a
thousand pounds!"
</p>

<p>
Her voice quivered and shook.  She was speaking
with an intensity of feeling unusual to her.  "I
watched the little colt as he grew up," she went
on, and her tone was low and plaintive now.  "I fed
him with my own hand, just as I feed Bess, and he
got to know and to love me.  I gloried over him
as I saw him growing handsomer and stronger&mdash;growing
into what I had expected he would.  I knew
he would win the Derby for me, every instinct I
have told me so.  And do you know, father"&mdash;she
drew a little closer to the old man's chair, but she
was not looking at him, she was absorbed in the
train of her own thoughts&mdash;"it was not only pride
that possessed me; Castor was going to make our
fortune for us&mdash;I felt that, too&mdash;and the money
would be mine, mine to do with as I wished.  I used
to sit and dream of the way I should spend that
money.  We were going to leave this ugly cottage,
and have everything nice and pretty about us;
we were going to start a new life altogether."  Poor
Rada!  It was such a vain, such a hopeless dream!
for, as far as her father was concerned at least, any
new life was out of the question.
</p>

<p>
She caught her breath, and went on speaking,
more to herself than to him, quite heedless of the
fact that she received no answer.  "Oh! it would
have been my money&mdash;mine, just as Castor was my
horse.  If you knew, if you could guess, how I
have built upon this!  But now there is to be no
more dreaming for me: the gold has been fairy
gold, it has slipped through my fingers like so
many dead leaves.  You have taken Castor from
me&mdash;you have sold him for a thousand pounds!
And now what is to be done?"
</p>

<p>
She choked down her sobs, clenched her little
fists with characteristic energy, vaguely conscious
of the futility of her emotional outburst, and her
natural energy of disposition once more coming to
the fore, she took a quick step towards her father.
"What is to be done?" she repeated.
</p>

<p>
There was no reply, save for a dull, unintelligent
grunt.  Captain Armitage's head was lolling over
the side of his chair, his eyes were closed, his mouth
open.  He was asleep&mdash;he had been asleep all
the while.
</p>

<p>
Rada's first impulse was to take him by the
shoulders and to shake him violently, for, small as
she was, she knew that she possessed more strength
than he.  Her nerves were tingling with suppressed
passion, her cheeks were suffused with colour.  She
touched him on the shoulder; he stirred and muttered,
then his hand went out instinctively towards
the table as though in search of his glass.
</p>

<p>
Rada drew back, nauseated.  She knew that it
was hopeless to protest with such a man as her
father&mdash;she must leave him to himself.  It was for
her alone to act.
</p>

<p>
A few moments later, having loosened his collar
and settled him as comfortably as she could in his
chair, a horrible task to which she was no stranger,
she stole quietly out of the room.
</p>

<p>
That same evening, Pierce Trelawny, who had
been detained by his father at Randor Park, arrived
to stay the night with Mostyn at Partinborough
Grange.  It was too late to visit the paddocks that
night, and, unfortunately, Pierce had to hurry on
to London by an early train the next day; but it
was arranged that Willis should take charge of his
bag, so that a hurried inspection of Mostyn's
purchase might be made the first thing in the morning,
after which Pierce could walk or drive to the
station.
</p>

<p>
The two young men had discussed the situation
as they sat together in the drawing-room of the
Grange after dinner.  Pierce had learnt the full
facts by letter, and, acting upon Mostyn's instructions,
he had kept the secret to himself.  He agreed
with Mostyn that this was the wisest plan, though
he asked, and obtained, permission to reveal
everything to his uncle, Sir Roderick, who, he opined,
might be of considerable assistance&mdash;if he chose&mdash;to
Mostyn in a difficult task.
</p>

<p>
For himself, he was prepared to lend all the help
in his power, and place his experience&mdash;such as it
was&mdash;quite at Mostyn's disposition.  It would
distract his thoughts from Cicely, and from the hardship
of his own year's probation.  "The governor hasn't
yielded an inch," he explained mournfully.  "And,
of course, I've written everything to Cicely.  I can't
make the old man out.  He threatens me with all
sorts of horrible consequences if I disobey him, and
all the time there's a sort of twinkle in his eye, as
if he found it amusing to bully me.  But about
yourself?  You've got to buck up, you know.
There's no time to be lost."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn acquiesced.  "I've made a start by
purchasing Castor," he said.  "That has cost me
a thousand pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Cheap, too, if the horse is all you tell me,"
commented the other.  "Well, you may run Castor
for the Guineas and for the Derby, but you mustn't
neglect your other chances.  What about the
Royal Hunt Cup?  That is the race which falls
first upon your list, I believe."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn quite agreed that the Royal Hunt Cup
must not be overlooked, although there only
remained a fortnight or three weeks in which to
purchase a horse, already entered, for this race.
"I suppose I ought to have set about it before,"
he said rather limply, "but the fact is, you see,
I've been busy getting this house in order, and&mdash;&mdash;"
he broke off suddenly.  He did not like to tell
Pierce the actual reason for which, having purchased
Castor, he had remained on at Partinborough.  The
fact was that he had been on the look-out every
day for Rada, that he could not tear himself away.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he blurted out the truth.  "The girl
fascinates me," he said, in conclusion.  "I can't
understand how, or why.  I don't quite know if I
hate or love her, but I'm quite sure that I want to
master her, to punish her somehow for having
mocked me.  She has challenged me twice, and
I want to be even with her.  That's how we stand."  He
blushed as he spoke, staring viciously at the
toe of his shoe.
</p>

<p>
Pierce gave a low whistle.  "You're in love,
Mostyn," he said, "and you've taken the complaint
rather badly and in a particularly dangerous style.
I shall have to get you out of this, and as quickly
as possible: you may think of Rada as much as
you like next year, or when you've won your title
to the legacy, but till then you must be on
probation, old chap, just as I am."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn agreed that his friend was right, and so
it was decided between them that he should join
Pierce in London in two or three days' time, and
that they should devote their energies to finding
suitable horses to run for the Hunt Cup as well
as the Goodwood Cup a little later on.  As
a necessary preliminary step, Pierce had already
entered Mostyn for the National Sporting Club
and also for the Albert and the Victoria, and the
sooner he put in an appearance there, to make
the acquaintance of the leading sporting men, the
better.
</p>

<p>
The two friends reached the paddocks very
early the next morning, and Pierce looked Castor
over before the colt was led out of his stable to
exercise.  He scrutinised the animal with the eye
of a man of experience, and commented upon this
and that point in a manner which filled Mostyn
with envy.
</p>

<p>
"Plenty of mettle and spirit," he said, dodging
quickly out of the way, as Castor, conscious no
doubt of a strange hand upon his hock, pranced
to and fro in his stall.  "In fine condition, too.
I can see nothing to carp at; if half of old William
Treves's tales are true, I should say you've got
a good thing, Mostyn, and cheap at the price you
paid."
</p>

<p>
Pierce's good opinion was in no way altered
when he had seen the horse at exercise.  He stood
with his friend by the stable wall facing the great
bare track of country, over which Treves's horses
followed each other in straight, unbroken line.
William Treves himself was absent that day at
Newmarket, but presently the two young men
were joined by his son Jack, who strolled leisurely
up, and began to talk in his usual familiar fashion.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had seen a good deal of Jack Treves
during the past week, and nearer acquaintance
had not improved his liking.  He was quite sure
that the trainer's son had conceived a jealousy of
him, imagining, no doubt, that he and Rada were
old friends.  It was very evident by the way he
spoke of her that Jack considered he had a claim
upon Rada's affections, a claim which Mostyn,
jealous in his turn, resented.
</p>

<p>
Having seen Castor put through his paces, Pierce
was loud in his praise of Mostyn's purchase,
repeating all he had said in the stable, and even
appealing to Jack Treves to confirm his opinion.
The latter stood lounging against a post, smoking
a cigarette, his thick lips parted in an irritating
smile.  Mostyn could not help thinking that there
was something at the back of his brain to which he
did not wish to give expression.  He had laughed
outright once or twice without apparent cause,
and there was a palpable sneer on his lips as he
turned to Mostyn and informed him that Miss
Armitage had returned the day before, and would
no doubt put in an appearance that morning.
</p>

<p>
Jack had divined correctly.  It was as Castor,
bestridden by a stable lad, was drawn up almost
opposite to them, and while the attention of all
three was bestowed upon the horse, that Mostyn
heard a voice close behind him, calling him by
name, and turned to find himself face to face with
Rada.  She had ridden up upon Bess, had dismounted,
leaving the mare to wander at will, and
had approached unnoticed.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clithero."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn felt that peculiar thrill pass through him
which was always called forth by her presence.
As on a former occasion her Christian name had
nearly escaped his lips, but this time he was able
to check himself.  There was a glitter in the girl's
eyes, and her lips were drawn together in a manner
which appeared to him rather ominous.  It was
the first time he had seen her dressed in a riding
habit, and he thought how well it became her;
at the same time he was glad that she had not
abandoned her straw hat, the red poppies of which
toned in so well with the dark tresses beneath
them.  She was looking deliriously pretty, but
Mostyn wondered in what mood she would display
herself.  He had been forced to accept Captain
Armitage's assurances about Castor, but, all the
same, he had not been wholly satisfied.  He
remembered her challenge as to winning a Derby,
"with some chance of success, too," she had said.
Could she have been thinking of Castor?
</p>

<p>
But of course the colt was his by every right.
He turned, smiling brightly, and extended his
hand to the girl.  She responded, but her fingers
lay cold and passive in his grasp.  "We've been
watching Castor at exercise, Miss Armitage," he
said with enthusiasm.  "He's a beauty, and I can't
tell you how grateful I am to you for letting me
have him.  I've brought my friend Mr. Trelawny
to see him: you know Mr. Trelawny, I think."
</p>

<p>
Pierce, with every intention of saying the right
thing, piled fuel to the fire as he, in his turn, shook
hands with Rada.  "I was awfully surprised," he
said, "to learn that Mostyn had been lucky enough
to buy such a horse as Castor.  I was saying only
just now, that if one could judge of a Derby winner
from a two-year-old&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The frown on Rada's forehead deepened, her
lips puckered up, and her uncontrollable tongue had
its way.  "I should hate Castor to win the Derby
for Mr. Clithero or for anyone else.  Castor is my
horse, and he was sold without my consent."  She
turned passionately upon Mostyn, her black eyes
shining.  "It was mean and cowardly of you!"
she said.  "You did it because of what I said to
you the other day.  You did it to spite me!
Can't you fight fair?  Aren't there enough horses
in the world for you to buy, without robbing me
of the one ambition, the one hope of my life?"
</p>

<p>
Jack Treves chuckled.  The scene had begun
just as he had anticipated.  But Rada turned and
fixed her eyes indignantly upon him, and he took
the hint and moved away.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Armitage, I had no idea," stammered
Mostyn; "believe me&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"May I have a few words with you alone?"
she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn glanced helplessly at his friend.  Pierce
awkwardly pulled out his watch.  "It's time I was
off," he said hurriedly.  "It will take me a few
minutes to get to the station, and really there's
only just time.  We shall meet on Friday as
arranged."
</p>

<p>
He took hasty leave of his friend and of Rada.
"Jove, how her eyes glistened!" he muttered to
himself as he hurried away.  "Can Mostyn really
have fallen in love with the girl?  Why, she's&mdash;she's
a regular little spit-fire; what's more, she'll
have the horse back, if I'm not mistaken."  He
gave one of his characteristic whistles.  "Poor
Mostyn!" he added sympathetically.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN MAKES REPARATION.
</h3>

<p>
"Take the horse away!" commanded Rada,
petulantly, as soon as Pierce had disappeared.
The stable-lad mounted upon Castor had been
staring at the little group, undecided if he was
still wanted, or if the inspection of the horse was
concluded.
</p>

<p>
"Take him away!" she repeated, flashing angry
eyes upon the boy.  "I can't bear to look at him
now," she added under her breath.
</p>

<p>
The lad touched the reins and Castor trotted
quickly away.  Mostyn and Rada were left in the
comparative solitude of the great open space,
though every now and again the sound of shouting
came to them from the distance, and through the
mist of the morning they could discern the shadowy
forms of men and horses.
</p>

<p>
Rada sank down upon a bench, clasping her
little hands about her knees; Mostyn stood by her
side, waiting till she should have composed herself.
He anticipated a painful scene: his worst fears
had been realised, and even from the few words
she had spoken, he understood what Rada must
think of him.  Of course, he was really guiltless
of offence; he had been deceived, swindled, but
even though Rada recognised this, she would still
think that, actuated by his desire to checkmate
her, he had taken the opportunity of gaining an
unfair advantage.
</p>

<p>
He was sorry for Rada, and he was sorry for
himself as well, for he saw at once where lay his
duty.  He knew even now what he would have to
do.  There must be no imputation of unfairness
against him: he was bound, by the force of
circumstances, to a contest with the girl, but he
would fight in the open.  She had issued the
challenge with all the advantage on her side, but
he felt no animosity against her for this: she had
spoken just as she, a wayward, impulsive girl,
might have been expected to speak.  His only
trouble was that she should have grounds for
thinking ill of him.
</p>

<p>
He no longer felt bashful and shy in her presence.
So much, at least, was in his favour.  He seemed
to know and understand her better for having seen
the squalor and wretchedness of her home, for
having realised the surroundings in which she
lived.  Then the Willis's had spoken so freely of
her, almost every day, encouraged, of course, by
Mostyn; he had felt at last that he had known the
girl for years, and that her vagaries were no new
thing to him.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps he knew her better than she knew
herself; so Mostyn, who had had no experience of
women, told himself in his conceit.  It was all
very well for her to pretend to be hard and wayward
and selfish: he knew better.  He knew what reason
the villagers had for loving her; why, only yesterday
old Mrs. Oldham at the post office had told him how
Rada had given up days and days to nurse a little
child who was ill with bronchitis, and who might
have died of it had it not been for Rada's care of
her.  "If I could make her see herself and show
herself to me in her true character," Mostyn
muttered, "then we might be&mdash;well, friends, as
well as rivals.  If I could!"
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, as well as having no knowledge
of women, Mostyn was not possessed of
much tact.  And so, as usual, he blundered
egregiously when he attempted to put his ideas
into practice.
</p>

<p>
"I think, Mr. Clithero," Rada began, "that you
have taken a very mean way of revenging yourself
upon me.  I thought you would have had more
manly feelings&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He knew what she meant, but he was in such
a hurry to defend himself that he failed to find
the words he wanted.
</p>

<p>
"I was rude to you the other night," Rada went
on relentlessly.  "I was rude to you at the Derby.
I couldn't help myself.  I always say just what
comes into my head."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was quite aware of this, but he did not
mean to say so; he wanted to be very gentle with
Rada, quite unconscious that gentleness was the
one thing which in her present temper she would
resent.  "I don't think you meant to hurt," he
said softly.
</p>

<p>
"I did," she retorted viciously.  "You made
such an idiot of yourself, nobody could have helped
being rude and laughing at you.  And yet it's
you&mdash;a man who hasn't the smallest idea of racing,
a man who'd buy a donkey and enter it for the
Derby if he acted upon his own intelligence&mdash;it's
you who, because you know I laid store by my
horse, and because you've got some insane idea in
your head of besting me on the racecourse&mdash;it's
you who've played me this trick!"  She spoke
violently without the smallest attempt to weigh
her words.  "You knew Castor was mine," she
went on.  "You must have guessed it from what
I said the other night.  You knew, too, that my
father is not to be depended upon.  And if you
had not known all that, Jack Treves told you the
truth immediately after you had made the purchase;
there was plenty of time to repair the error, if you
had not been spiteful against me."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn flushed, stung by the injustice, but he
was quite determined that he would not lose his
temper.  "You misjudge me," he said, "you
misjudge me utterly.  The whole thing has been
a mistake, and if I have been to blame in any way
I am quite willing to repair the error."  He had
no wish to enter into any long explanation, or to
cast the blame where he knew it was merited, upon
Rada's father.  He realised, and very probably
correctly, that this would only appear a further
meanness in the girl's eyes.  "The position is very
simple," he went on, "and there is no need for
you to scold me, Miss Armitage; please consider
that Castor is yours."
</p>

<p>
It was Rada's turn to flush, for this was
just what her father had hinted at, what
he had no doubt relied upon.  To accept Castor
as a gift at Mostyn's hands was the very last
thing which, in her present mood, she was
prepared to do.
</p>

<p>
She drew herself up stiffly.  "You are very
kind," she said, "but do you think that
we are beggars, my father and I, that you
dare to make such a suggestion?  What are
you to me that I should accept a present
from you?"
</p>

<p>
"Since there has been a mistake," Mostyn said,
vainly striving to reconcile the girl's inconsistency
in his mind, "I want to repair it the best way
I can."
</p>

<p>
"Quite forgetting that there is such a thing as
pride," Rada interrupted, "and that I have my
fair share of it.  No, Mr. Clithero, you have bought
Castor, and Castor is yours, unless I am able to
purchase him back.  That is what I wish to see
you about.  I love my horse," she went on, sucking
in her lips as though she found it difficult to make
her explanation, "and there are many reasons
why Castor should be particularly dear to me.
So, since, as you say, the whole thing has been
a mistake, you will let me buy Castor back.  My
father is bound to let me have the money," she
added mendaciously, "when he knows how badly
I want my horse."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn knew that this was not true, that Captain
Armitage was the last man in the world to disgorge
any money that he had become possessed of
by any means whatsoever.  He knew, too,
that there were certainly no funds upon which
Rada could draw, and he wondered vaguely how
she proposed to raise a thousand pounds to
repay him.
</p>

<p>
"I'd far sooner give you the horse," he said,
"for, after all, I should be returning you your
own.  I want to have a shot for the next
Derby, Miss Armitage," he went on, "and it
isn't only because I have a sort of a bet with
you.  That's a motive with me, certainly, but
it isn't all.  However, I can find another horse,
and really the money is of no importance to me.
We are rivals, you and I, both eager to win, but
both wanting to play the game fairly.  You shall
have Castor and I will look out for myself; is
that a bargain?"
</p>

<p>
"Not unless I can pay you the thousand pounds,"
she retorted.  "But if I can succeed in doing that,
and without undue delay, Castor shall be mine
again, and our rivalry can begin as soon as ever
you like."  She laughed derisively.  "If it does,
I don't think there'll be much chance for you,
Mr. Clithero."
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders, seeing no use in
argument.  He did not want to accept Rada's
thousand pounds, but he had sense to see that it
was quite useless, as matters stood, to suggest
any other solution of the difficulty.
</p>

<p>
"It shall be just as you please, Miss Armitage,"
he said with an effort to appear cheerful.  "I'm
going to do my best to win the Derby, but it won't
be with Castor."
</p>

<p>
She rose from the bench upon which she had
been sitting and once more extended her cold
hand.  "Thank you," she said.  "There's nothing
more to be settled for the present between us.
You shall have your money and I my horse.  That's
decided."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn held her hand in his for a moment,
despite her effort to withdraw it.  He looked
straight into her eyes.  "I wonder," he said,
"why we always meet to quarrel?  I should
like to be on better terms with you, Miss
Armitage.  We can be rivals and yet good
friends, can't we?  I am sorry that this misunderstanding
should have happened, but really I'm
not to blame."
</p>

<p>
He released the girl's hand, which fell to her
side.  Rada tapped the ground petulantly with
her foot.  Truth to tell, she was a little ashamed
of herself.  Mostyn may not have been so much
to blame, after all; her father had a plausible
tongue.  But she was in a mood when to admit
herself in the wrong would have been an
impossibility for her.  Had Mostyn been wise he
would have left her alone; reflection and
repentance would have come in due course.
As it was, she hated him at that moment even
for his offer to return Castor to her.  How
dared he even think that she would consent to
such a thing?
</p>

<p>
She had no dislike for Mostyn really.  In her
heart she admired his clean, well-cut features,
his stalwart, manly frame.  More than once she
had mentally compared him with other men of
her acquaintance, especially with Jack Treves,
and the comparison had been all in Mostyn's
favour.  Perhaps it was because she did not
understand her own feelings, because she was too
contradictory to yield to them, that she had
always instinctively adopted an aggressive attitude
when with Mostyn.  In a sense it was against
herself that she was fighting.  How could she,
who had been brought up almost from babyhood
to the love of sport, have any esteem for
such a greenhorn as this otherwise good-looking
and good-tempered boy?  It was that feeling
that had impelled her to make fun of him, and
which had caused her to resent bitterly what she
had regarded as an attempt on his part to get
the better of her.
</p>

<p>
A peculiar pugnacity had been aroused within
her; perhaps the wild and wayward little
creature was moved, without knowing it, by
the natural strife between sex and sex.  She
felt instinctively the desire of the man to subdue
and win her, and all her senses were accordingly
in revolt.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you think I'm a little minx, a sort
of wild cat," she said, not looking at him but
at the ground.  "It's been my fault that
we've quarrelled, and now you are reproaching
me for it."
</p>

<p>
"You're hard to understand, Ra&mdash;Miss
Armitage," Mostyn said; "there's no doubt
whatever about that, but I don't think you are a bit
the minx you are inclined to make yourself out
to be."  He was staring at her, admiring her neat
figure with its delicate curves, her nicely poised
head, and her black curls that, in the sunlight,
had a tint of glowing blue in them; he could
not see her eyes, but he imagined that they
must glint with the same blue.  He wanted her
to look up, but she still stared at the little
well-shod foot with which she was still tapping
the ground.
</p>

<p>
"Yes I am, I'm bad-tempered; I say cruel
things; I hurt people!  But why shouldn't I?"
she added defiantly, "when there's no one I care
for and no one who cares for me?  I've been
brought up like that.  I am hard by nature, and
I don't see why I should pretend to be any other
than I am."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn laughed a little.  "I know better," he
said.  "You've got a heart of gold, Miss Armitage,
though out of sheer perversity you don't like
people to know it.  But I've found you out,
you see, though we've only known each other
such a little while and quarrelled every time
we've met."
</p>

<p>
"What do you mean?" she cried.  She was
looking up now, and her eyes had the blue glint
in them, just as he had expected.  They flashed
upon him, but he could not tell if it were with
anger or surprise.
</p>

<p>
"You say that nobody loves you, and you love
nobody.  If so, why are you always doing little
acts of kindness to people?  Why do all the
villagers adore you?"
</p>

<p>
She stamped her foot.  "I've got to do something,"
she cried.  "I must occupy myself
somehow.  But that isn't the real me, the real Rada
Armitage; you are quite mistaken if you think so.
I'm as you've seen me, as I appear up in London&mdash;hard,
cruel, a flirt, everything that's bad.  Ask
my father; he always calls me a little devil;
I've been called a little devil ever since I can
remember."
</p>

<p>
"I know others who call you an angel, with an
aspirate tacked on," Mostyn laughed.  He was
rather enjoying himself; it was amusing telling
the girl her good qualities and hearing them so
violently contradicted.  It was Rada's nature to
contradict, that was very evident, but it was
quite delicious to make her protest that she was
all that was bad when the truth was so palpably
otherwise.
</p>

<p>
"What is one to believe, what you say yourself
or what others say of you?  I know what I think,"
he went on, more than half-conscious that he was
goading the girl into a fresh passion.  But how
could she resent it when he was really praising
her?  "The real Rada Armitage is kind-hearted
and good&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No she isn't, she's&mdash;oh, I don't know what
you are making me say!  You are perfectly
horrid!  What's the good of telling a girl
she's an angel when she feels quite the
reverse?  That's just like a man."  Rada
turned away, angrily biting her lip.  "I don't
want to hear any more of my virtues, thank
you, Mr. Clithero; I'd like you better if
you told me I was a beast.  And now please
excuse me, for I'm going to the stables to
see Jack Treves.  He doesn't tell me I'm an angel,"
she added viciously.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn made no reply; and after waiting a
moment as though she expected him to speak,
Rada turned on her heel and went in search of her
mare, which was quietly grazing close at hand.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap12"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN TELLS HIS LOVE.
</h3>

<p>
"A misunderstanding!  Yes, of course, absolutely
a misunderstanding."  Captain Armitage
waved his arm airily, as he expressed this opinion.
"I'm sorry that it should have happened, but
Rada quite gave me to believe&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course.  I understand you would not
have sold Castor to me unless you had concluded
that the sale had your daughter's approval."  Mostyn
spoke quite seriously, though he knew well
enough that the old man's excuses were not genuine;
but he had no desire to hurl reproaches at the
wretched drunkard, who, after all, was Rada's
father.  Mostyn told himself, with something of
that good humour under adverse circumstances
which was typical of him, that he ought to have
known better at the beginning; that he ought to
have judged his man, and that it was his own fault
he had been taken in.
</p>

<p>
The loss of a thousand pounds seemed of little
importance to him just then, for he had resources
behind him which, to his inexperience, seemed
inexhaustible.  He was at heart an optimist, and
did not doubt, in spite of this reverse, that he
would successfully carry out the terms of Anthony
Royce's will.  Taken altogether, there were a dozen
races open to him, and surely, with so much money
at his disposition, he would be able to find a winner
for one of them.
</p>

<p>
So it was that in the afternoon of that day,
Mostyn had come to Captain Armitage's house,
had explained that there had evidently been a
mistake over the sale of Castor, and announced
his desire to return the horse to Rada, its legitimate
proprietor.  Since Rada had refused to accept the
horse, Mostyn had seen this as the only possible
way open to him.  He did not for a minute believe
that the girl would be able to raise the thousand
pounds, and he thought that when her temper
subsided and she understood what had been done
she would accept the situation without further
protest.  Mostyn rather plumed himself upon his
diplomacy.
</p>

<p>
Since the sun was shining brightly, Captain
Armitage was lolling in a deck-chair which he had
placed very near the centre of the wretched little
lawn of Barton Mill House, and he had been
indulging in a nap when Mostyn had interrupted
him.  He had not been in the best of humours at
first, evidently preparing to meet an attack,
anticipating a demand for explanations; but Mostyn
had quickly undeceived him, and stated clearly
what he intended to do, after which, as well he
might, Captain Armitage had subsided into smiles
and amiability.
</p>

<p>
"You want me to take Castor back?" he said.
"Very well, very well."  There was certainly no
pride about Captain Armitage.  "A mistake has
been made "&mdash;he rubbed his bony hands together&mdash;"and
nobody is to blame; neither you nor Rada,
nor I&mdash;certainly not I&mdash;and you want to put
matters straight."
</p>

<p>
"You are certainly the one who has profited by
the mistake," Mostyn could not help saying.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, my dear young friend"&mdash;Armitage puffed
at his cigar, another extracted from the expensive
box which he had brought back from London, and
which had been purchased with Mostyn's
money&mdash;"somebody must usually profit, and somebody
lose by every mistake.  In this case it's you who
lose, and of course I'm sorry for you.  I'd willingly
stand my share of the loss; I'd refund&mdash;yes, I'd
willingly refund you five hundred pounds&mdash;only,
unfortunately, the money is already involved&mdash;that
is, I've made the bets I spoke to you about.  But
look here"&mdash;he started up from his chair in the
jerky manner peculiar to him&mdash;"you shall have
the tips, and that's just like putting money into
your pocket.  You won't regret having had a deal
with Captain Armitage.  You back Cardigan for
the Royal Hunt Cup; put your bottom dollar
on it&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," said Mostyn coldly.  "I don't
bet; I never intend to bet."
</p>

<p>
"Don't bet!" Armitage sank back into his
chair again.  "Well, I'm blessed!  Here's a young
man who professes to be going in for racing, and
who says he doesn't bet!  Never heard of such
a thing, never!"  Armitage stared at Mostyn as
though he were looking upon some new and
remarkable species of animal.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you don't understand racing for
the mere sake of sport," Mostyn said.  "Anyway,
that's how it appeals to me, and though I've lost
Castor I propose to look out for another horse for
next year's Derby.  Your daughter and I are
going to be rivals, Captain Armitage."
</p>

<p>
The captain was on the alert again.  "Another
horse&mdash;next year's Derby," he mused.  "Well, let
me see; perhaps I can be of use to you after
all."  He was evidently turning over in his mind the
means of effecting another deal, probably as
advantageous to himself as the last.
</p>

<p>
But Mostyn wanted no further business dealings
with Captain Armitage.  "Thank you," he said,
"but I need no assistance in this matter.  But now
as to Castor," he went on; "I want it to be clearly
understood&mdash;and you must write me a letter to
this effect, Captain Armitage&mdash;that the horse is
to be, and to remain, your daughter's property:
Castor is to run in the Derby in her name, and of
course, should he win, the money that accrues is
to be her property absolutely.  Upon that
understanding, and that understanding only, I give up
possession."
</p>

<p>
"Surely, surely.  It shall be just as you wish.
I always meant Rada to have Castor, and I don't
grudge her the money a bit," said Armitage
magnanimously.  "I'll write you the letter&mdash;yes,
certainly.  And now you'll have a drink, won't
you, since this matter has been so amicably
settled?  And perhaps I can find you one of these
cigars; I can recommend them."  To give away
a cigar was an extravagance of which Captain
Armitage was rarely guilty, but one, upon this
occasion, he felt he could afford.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, however, refused both the drink and the
cigar.  He took his leave of Captain Armitage,
feeling after this, his second dealing with that
gentleman, that Rada was more than ever to be
excused for her waywardness and inconsistency.
</p>

<p>
"With such a father," he muttered to himself,
as he swung along the leafy lanes, "brought up by
him in the atmosphere of that wretched cottage,
with no other example before her&mdash;good heavens!
It's a wonder she's turned out as well as she has.
And beautiful, too&mdash;for she is a beauty, there's no
denying that; she must inherit her looks from her
mother.  What a pity&mdash;what a terrible pity for
the girl&mdash;that her mother died when she was little
more than a baby.  It's just that that she has
missed out of her life, the influence of a woman,
the tender hand of a mother."
</p>

<p>
So Mostyn mused.  The only thing that troubled
him really was what Pierce would say about his
quixotic conduct.  Pierce did not seem as sanguine
as Mostyn upon the subject of the purchase of a colt
suitable to run in the Derby; Pierce, too, had
expressed decided approval of Castor, and would
probably call his friend a fool for having given him
up.  And Mostyn hated above all things appearing
a fool, either in his own eyes or those of anyone
else; which perhaps accounted for the great desire
that was in him to set himself right with Rada.
</p>

<p>
Upon his way home, taking a short cut, he had
to pass by a footway that led through some meadows
and then skirted a little wood, a path that was very
popular with the young people of the neighbourhood,
and which had been given the name of
"Lovers' Walk."  So it happened that he was
not at all astonished when, upon a bench
conveniently placed in the shadow of a large elm,
a bench set back a little from the footpath and
partially concealed by the leafy branches of the
tree, he found a man and a girl seated in the usual
close proximity to each other.  It was not, however,
till he came abreast with them that he recognised
Jack Treves and Rada.
</p>

<p>
The girl, hearing footsteps, had started to her
feet.  Jack remained seated, his long legs stretched
out, and his lips curved derisively as Mostyn
approached.  Rada had flushed red and she took
a step forward, as though she would have spoken
to Mostyn; then she changed her mind and merely
recognised his presence by a little perfunctory nod
of her head.  As for Mostyn himself, after a quick
glance at Jack, he altogether ignored that individual.
He raised his hat to Rada and passed on his way.
</p>

<p>
He walked on without turning his head,
unconscious of the scowl that followed him and the
muttered oath.  But all the beauty had gone out
of the day for him, all the colour from the trees
and hedges.  He saw a stretch of ugly, undulating,
monotonous country, devoid of charm.  It depressed
him.
</p>

<p>
"What possesses her to care for a fellow like
that?" he muttered under his breath.  "A
low-down cad, and one whom it isn't safe for her to be
about with?  She must know his reputation, and
how everyone's talking about him and Daisy
Simpson even now.  Why, I saw him with Daisy
only this morning outside the stables!  I saw
him kiss her."  Mostyn waved his stick and
viciously decapitated an unoffending dandelion as
he spoke.
</p>

<p>
It was quite true that Jack Treves enjoyed,
literally enjoyed, for he was proud of it, a bad
reputation in Partinborough.  Those gossips, the
Willis's, were responsible for Mostyn's knowledge.
Mrs. Willis hated to see her dearly beloved Rada
in Jack's company, and spoke her mind fluently
on the subject.  "Let him stick to his Daisy
Simpson," she said.  "Daisy's good enough for
the likes of him.  They're birds of a feather.  But
Miss Rada is a lady, though her father's an old
drunkard, and there's the width of the world
between her and that scapegrace Jack."
</p>

<p>
Daisy Simpson, as Mostyn soon found out, was
the daughter of a well-to-do farmer in the
neighbourhood.  She was, according to Mrs. Willis,
a "fast lot," notorious for her flirtations.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn would not have enjoyed the conversation
between Rada and Jack that followed his passing,
had he overheard it.  Yet, in a way, his mind
might have been set at rest as to the existing
relationship between the pair, and he would certainly
have appreciated Rada's immediate championship
of his name, when Jack applied an insulting epithet
to it.
</p>

<p>
"None of that, please, Jack," said the girl firmly,
lifting a small but authoritative hand.  "I may
laugh at Mr. Clithero, if I choose, to his face, but
I won't hear him abused behind his back.  That's
not cricket.  Remember that he offered to give me
back Castor for nothing, though he's got some
wild sort of notion in his head that he must win
a Derby before I do.  He was tricked into buying
Castor&mdash;there's no blinking at that fact&mdash;and he
has taken his disappointment like a man."
</p>

<p>
"Look here," said Jack, in a voice that would
have been harsh had he been speaking to anyone
but Rada, "I want to know how I stand.  If
I help you as you want me to&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"As you have promised," she interrupted.
</p>

<p>
"Well, as I have promised.  What I mean is,
I can't have any sentimental foolery between you
and any other chap, see?  You say you won't
marry me till this time next year in any case&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Can I think of marrying," asked Rada,
indignantly, "or give any promise even, when all
my thoughts are fixed on Castor and the Derby?
You've just got to wait, Jack."
</p>

<p>
"All right," he grumbled, "though I don't
think you're treating me fair.  But this little
service I'm doin' you will make a bit of a bond
between us, Rada.  I take it for as good as an
engagement; you understand that, don't you?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said the girl petulantly, and with
her usual thoughtlessness.  "But don't worry me
now, Jack.  I'm all impatience to get this business
settled.  Let's go back to the stables."
</p>

<p>
The man did not move.  He was digging a hole
in the soft earth with his heel.  "No hurry," he
said.  "I brought you out here to talk this matter
over.  I know I'm all right up to date.  Your
father's quite ready that I should marry you; he
knows I've got the brass.  It's only you I'm not
sure about since this fellow Clithero came along.
You may have seen a lot of him in London, for all
I can tell.  What were you doin' round at the
Grange the other night?"
</p>

<p>
"So it was you, was it?" exclaimed Rada.
"I thought so.  You frightened me.  Why were you
hanging about the house?  Was it because you
thought I should be alone?"  She spoke out
fearlessly, and from the man's manner she knew
she had divined the truth.
</p>

<p>
"I was jealous," he muttered.  It was a palpable lie,
since he could not have known of Mostyn's arrival.
</p>

<p>
Rada let it pass.  She was too eagerly bent upon
attaining her own desire to weigh consequences.
</p>

<p>
"It's getting late," she said impatiently.  "We
must be going, Jack."  She tugged at his sleeve,
seeking vainly to induce him to rise.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me first," he said, "that this fellow
Clithero is nothing to you.  I'm not afraid of
anything else.  Whether Castor wins the Derby or
not you'll be engaged to me this time next year.
But let me hear you say what I want."
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Clithero is nothing to me, nothing at all,"
exclaimed Rada, biting her lip.  "I only met him
once before that evening at the Grange, and then
I was rude to him.  I was rude to him again that
night.  I expect he hates me, and will hate me
all the more because of Castor."  She spoke
vehemently, just as the words came to her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Good!"  Jack rose languidly and slowly from
the bench.  "Then we'll be gettin' back and I'll
do as you ask me."  He passed his arm under
hers with an air of proprietorship; then, as they
stood under the shadow of the trees, stooped to
kiss her.
</p>

<p>
She started away from him.  "No, not that,
Jack," she cried.  "Don't treat me like another
Daisy Simpson.  I'm not that sort.  We're not
engaged yet, whatever we may be next year.  If
you want me you've got to wait, and that's
irrevocable."
</p>

<p>
"All right," grumbled the man.  "But you're
a maddenin', aggravatin' little vixen, Rada, and the
Lord knows why I should trouble myself so much
about you.  You've got a hold on me somehow,
and I expect you'll keep it."
</p>

<p>
And, so, walking now staidly by her side, he
conducted her back to his father's house, which
adjoined the stables.
</p>

<p>
About nine o'clock that night Mostyn sat in the
drawing-room of the Grange, studying a book on
breeding, "Hodgson's Breeding Tables."  He was
quite alone in the house.  After a time, however,
his thoughts wandered, and, naturally, they turned
to Rada.
</p>

<p>
As he thought of the girl there came a tap upon
the open window, and looking up, he saw her there,
a small elf-like figure standing in the moonshine.
</p>

<p>
He started up from his chair, dropping the book
upon the floor, as she entered the room.  There
was a smile upon her lips, a smile that was
triumphant but not altogether happy, and he
thought that there were dark borders to her eyes,
black rings which he had not noticed before.
</p>

<p>
"I knew that you would be alone in the house,"
she said, "and that's why I did not trouble to go
to the front door."
</p>

<p>
"Rada, I'm delighted," he began.
</p>

<p>
"So am I," she interrupted, "delighted that
I am able to settle up the matter of Castor so
quickly.  Here is your money."  She had been
holding her left hand behind her; now she drew
it forward and dropped upon the table a little
crumpled packet of bank-notes.  "A thousand
pounds," she said defiantly.  "You'd better count
them and see if they are right."
</p>

<p>
"Rada!"  Mostyn spoke her name boldly.  He
had noticed the trembling of the little white hand
which had dropped the notes upon the table; he
had noticed, too, a tone of desperation in the girl's
voice&mdash;a tone which she had attempted to conceal
by assumed bravado.  He seized her hand before
she could draw it away, and held it tightly
in his own.  "Rada, where did you get that
money?"
</p>

<p>
She struggled with him, but ineffectually.
"What does it matter to you where I got the
money," she panted, "and how dare you call me
Rada?  Let me go.  I've paid my debt, and that's
all I came for."
</p>

<p>
"I don't want the money."  He took the notes
in his free hand, crushing them in his strong fingers.
"Don't you understand that Castor is yours already?
I've given him back to your father, who has accepted
him on your behalf.  He made no suggestion of
repaying the thousand pounds, and I know that it
isn't from him that you've got the money."
</p>

<p>
A suspicion of the truth had flashed into Mostyn's
brain, and he spoke sternly, keeping his eyes fixed
upon the girl's face.
</p>

<p>
She made another effort to release her hand, but
a more feeble one.  Somehow the touch of Mostyn's
fingers upon her wrist, the firm grip of them, was
not unpleasing to her; she felt his mastery, she felt
that she was dealing with a man.
</p>

<p>
"What right have you to question me?" she
panted.
</p>

<p>
"No right&mdash;except that I love you."  The words
came out against his will; he had had no intention
whatever of speaking them.
</p>

<p>
"You love me!"  Suddenly she ceased to
struggle.  A look that was almost one of terror
came into her eyes.  Of his own accord Mostyn
released her hand.  She stood staring at him,
motionless, save for the quick rise and fall of her
bosom.
</p>

<p>
"You love me!" she repeated, then she broke out
into wild, almost hysterical, laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you little untamed, self-willed thing!  I do
love you, and I'm not going to let you make a fool
of yourself.  I shouldn't have told you I cared, if
it had not been for that."
</p>

<p>
"But you love me!" she repeated, breaking off
in her laughter.  "Why do you love me?  I can't
understand it.  I've never been even nice to
you&mdash;I've been a little beast.  And we've hardly met
more than four times in our lives.  Yet you love me."
</p>

<p>
"Heaven knows why," he returned.  "Who can
understand or explain these things?  You've wound
yourself round my heart in some extraordinary way.
I've hated and loved you at the same time.  You've
never been out of my thoughts.  Sometimes I don't
know even now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
She turned upon him sharply.  "Whether it's
hate or love," she prompted, laughing again, but
at the same time clasping her hands nervously
together.  "They say the two are akin.  But it
had better be hate, Mr. Clithero.  You said yourself
this morning that we must be rivals, and rivals can't
love each other, you know.  You want to beat me
out of the field, and I want to beat you&mdash;that's why
I've bought back my Castor.  Do you think I
would ever have accepted him from you as a gift?
Never, never!  Without that money I should have
given Castor up.  But I knew how I could get it
when I spoke to you this morning: yes, I knew
what I had to do."
</p>

<p>
She had moved away from him, and had placed
the width of a little table between them.  She stood
by this, leaning her hands heavily upon it as though
she needed its support.
</p>

<p>
"We are to be rivals," she continued, "there's
no getting away from it.  You'd better hate me,
Mr. Clithero, for if you get the better of me at the
Derby I shall hate you&mdash;I can tell you that."
</p>

<p>
"No, I love you."  Mostyn moved round the
table as though to take her in his arms, to crush her
into submission.  But she lifted one hand with an
imperious gesture.
</p>

<p>
"Don't speak of loving me," she cried; "it's
absurd, impossible."  Again she laughed hysterically.
Her eyes were soft, and Mostyn thought he
could detect a suspicious moisture glistening upon
her lashes; but her voice belied her eyes.  "It's
just like with Castor," she panted.  "You wanted
Castor when there were so many other horses you
might have bought.  Now you want me, when
there are hundreds of other girls."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me"&mdash;Mostyn paid no heed to her wild
and unreasoning words&mdash;"is there anyone else,
Rada?"  The recollection of the meeting that
afternoon came to his mind.  "Do you love Jack
Treves?  Is it from him that you have obtained
this money&mdash;money that I don't want, and won't
touch?  You are not engaged to him&mdash;I should
have heard of it if you were.  My God!"  A
thought struck him, and he stepped quickly forward
and passed his strong arm about the girl.  "Rada,
oh, you poor little thing!  Look at me, if you
can&mdash;tell me that you haven't promised yourself to him
in return for this wretched money."
</p>

<p>
Her head was bent, he tried to lift it, and to look
into her eyes.  He felt her yielding to him; he felt
the trembling of her limbs, the heaving of her
breast, the quick panting of her breath.  He was
trembling, too, as he gradually raised her face to
his, as he gazed down into her eyes that were
glistening with tears and with a strange light he had
never seen in them before, as he marked her full,
red lips, lips a little parted, and that seemed to
shape an appeal.
</p>

<p>
"Rada," he cried wildly, "you don't love any
other man?  I can read it in your eyes.  Rada,
I love you."  His lips were to hers, and for one
moment&mdash;a moment in which all the emotions of
a lifetime were crowded, she lay impassive in his
arms.
</p>

<p>
Then, as if she were suddenly aroused from a
dream, a shudder passed through her, her body
stiffened, and with a low cry, a sob, she struggled free.
</p>

<p>
"How dare you, how dare you?" she gasped.
She sped swiftly to the window, leaving Mostyn
standing aghast before this fresh inconsistency of
woman.  "I'll never forgive you&mdash;never!  I&mdash;I
hate you."
</p>

<p>
With which she swung out into the night, and a
moment later Mostyn could hear her sobbing as she
ran down the gravel path.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN PREPARES FOR BATTLE.
</h3>

<p>
"Well, my boy, I'm glad to have seen you,
and to have heard all about this curious
business from your own lips.  Gad, I could
hardly believe it, when Pierce first told me, but
thought he was trying to pull my leg!  The young
dog, it's just the sort of thing he might have been
capable of."
</p>

<p>
Genial "Old Rory" smiled indulgently at his
nephew, and then turned again to Mostyn, to whom
he had been addressing himself.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, you may depend upon me to do all
I can to help you.  It's about the finest sporting
event I've ever come across in my life, and there's
humour in it, too"&mdash;Sir Roderick's broad features
reflected his appreciation of this&mdash;"just the sort of
humour that I should have expected of my poor
old friend, Anthony Royce.  To give a man&mdash;one
who knows nothing about racing&mdash;forgive me
Clithero, but that's true, isn't it?&mdash;a big capital, and
oblige him, if he's going to win a still bigger legacy
at the end of it, to steep himself in racing, just
because there's an old grudge to be paid off
against the legatee's father, who abhors racing
as he abhors the devil&mdash;well, there's
something that appeals to me in that, and I
wouldn't miss the fun of watching your progress
for the next year, no, not if I never won
another race in my life.  Here's luck to you,
Clithero!"&mdash;the old man lifted a foaming glass of
champagne to his lips as he spoke&mdash;"may you do
justice to yourself, to Royce's memory, and to
your father."
</p>

<p>
"Old Rory" laughed again as he spoke the last
words.  He was picturing to himself the expression
of John Clithero's face when the latter came to learn
that his son was becoming a prominent figure upon
the turf.
</p>

<p>
"He'll moan about the sins of the children being
visited upon the fathers," Sir Roderick muttered
to himself, then continued: "But don't you let out
your secret, my boy, not to a living soul except
those who are already in the know.  It's a good
thing your solicitors could keep it quiet for you.
If anything of the truth leaked out before you had
carried the job through, the difficulties of your task
would be magnified a hundred-fold.  You may
take that from me, and I know what I'm talking
about."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn and Pierce had been dining, as Sir
Roderick's guests, at the Imperial Club.  Mostyn
had only arrived in town the day before, and
Pierce, who had been impatiently awaiting him,
was not prepared to allow the grass to grow
under their feet.  He was as keenly interested
in Mostyn's success as was the latter himself.  The
dinner with Sir Roderick had been arranged at
his suggestion.
</p>

<p>
"'Old Rory' is the best fellow in the world,"
he had told Mostyn, "and he can do more for you
than any man I know of in London&mdash;introduce you
to the right sort of people, and all that kind of
thing.  If we can get him really interested in our
struggle, why, the battle will be more than half
won before it has commenced."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had been anxious at first that nothing
should be said to Sir Roderick MacPhane about the
unsatisfactory deal he had made over the colt
Castor; he was very shy of any allusion to Rada,
and the whole story of Captain Armitage's duplicity
could hardly have been touched upon without some
reference to the girl.
</p>

<p>
Besides, after all, so Mostyn had argued with
himself, Captain Armitage might be a disreputable
and altogether unscrupulous old man, but, nevertheless,
he was Rada's father, and so a privileged
person in Mostyn's eyes.  However, Pierce had
advised that the truth should be told, although, of
course, it was not necessary to mention by what
means Rada had succeeded in paying for the colt.
It was quite enough to explain that, after having
purchased Castor, Mostyn had discovered his
mistake and, out of consideration for Rada,
had consented to the whole transaction being
annulled.
</p>

<p>
To Pierce, Mostyn had unbosomed himself, making
a clean breast of everything; not even keeping back
the incidents of that passionate moment when he
had held Rada in his arms, and, goaded on by some
impulse that he hardly understood himself, had
told her of his love.  As a consequence he had been
forced to listen to what Pierce was pleased to call
a lecture upon worldly wisdom.  He had indeed
been rather severely taken to task.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Mostyn," Pierce had concluded by
saying, "you've got a stiff job before you, a task
which is far more difficult than you seem to think;
well, if you're going to win you must put all thoughts
of love-making and suchlike nonsense out of your
head.  I know it's jolly hard when a man gets taken
that way&mdash;I ought to know, oughtn't I? but I've
got my year's probation, and now you've got yours
as well.  Look at it in that light.  You've got to
think of horses for the next year, and horses only.
You'll come to grief if you go running after the
petticoats as well.  As for Rada, she is like an
untrained filly, and you will have your work cut
out for you if you think of breaking her in.  Do
as you like in a year, old man; but you can't stand
a handicap yet."
</p>

<p>
"You needn't worry about Rada, Pierce,"
Mostyn returned, without any loss of temper.
"There's not going to be any more love scenes
between her and myself.  Why, she said she
hated me, and we've never met yet without
quarrelling."
</p>

<p>
"That's all right, then."  Pierce had glanced
sharply at his friend's face as if to convince himself
that Mostyn was quite serious.  The innocent!
Why, according to his own tale, Rada had allowed
him to kiss her; she had rested for a few moments
in his arms before she had torn herself away, crying
and protesting, just as Pierce would have expected
of her, wayward little creature that she was; and
yet Mostyn did not seem to realise that the game
was in his own hands!  He had taken Rada quite
seriously!
</p>

<p>
Such was, indeed, the case, for Mostyn had left
Partinborough without seeing Rada again, quite
convinced that his company was odious to her.
</p>

<p>
Well, this was all for the best&mdash;so argued Pierce
to himself, and, as a wise man, with Mostyn's
best interest at heart, it would be folly for him to
point out any possibility of mistake.
</p>

<p>
After dinner was concluded that evening the
three men retired to the club smoking-room, in
order seriously to discuss Mostyn's projects for the
future, and, of course, Sir Roderick MacPhane was
allowed to be spokesman.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mostyn," he said&mdash;he had easily dropped
into the way of calling the young man by his
Christian name&mdash;"since you've lost Castor, I
expect you'll have to give up all hopes of
doing anything in next year's Derby.  You're not
likely to find another colt worth the
buying&mdash;certainly not one that could hold a candle to
Castor&mdash;or to my Pollux, for the matter of
that.  But, of course, if I have correctly grasped
the situation, the Derby is not a race that you
need consider seriously just yet.  You have plenty
of other chances to win your money, and it is
over those that you had better lay yourself out.
You've got to earn your legacy first, and then you'll
be in the position to direct all your attention to the
Derby&mdash;that is, if you're still anxious to make good
what you said upon my coach at Epsom a week
or so back&mdash;that you would win the classic race in
five years' time."
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick laughed heartily as he recalled the
scene.  "I didn't know what to make of you that
day, Mostyn," he continued, "but I understand
now, that it was Royce who instigated you to that
quixotic speech of yours.  You were being laughed
at.  Oh, my dear boy, how you flushed! and how
angry you looked with that little spitfire, Rada
Armitage!"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn flushed now as if to prove that he had not
yet lost the habit.  "I didn't understand what
Mr. Royce meant either," he replied, "but I just
said what he told me.  In fact, I said I would
win the Derby in five years' time instead of
ten, as he suggested in my ear.  Of course, I
was an arrant fool, and didn't know what I was
talking about."
</p>

<p>
"Well, you stand a very good chance, thanks to
our friend, Royce, of carrying your words into
effect," said Sir Roderick, "but, as I was saying,
unless you are absolutely pushed to it, I wouldn't
worry my head too much over next year's Derby.
If you should fail in all the other races that are
open to you, then, of course, we must see what is
to be done&mdash;for the Derby is the last chance you've
got, isn't it?  The year granted you by the terms
of the will terminates with the Epsom Summer
Meeting next year?"
</p>

<p>
"That is so," acquiesced Mostyn.  "The Oaks
will be absolutely my last chance."
</p>

<p>
"I understand."  The old sportsman was silent
for a few moments, leaning forward, his elbows
resting upon his knees, as if in thought.  Once, a
club friend, passing close to him, addressed him
by name, but "Old Rory" only looked up and
grunted, immediately afterwards resuming his
attitude of profound thought.  The man passed on
with a smile&mdash;"Old Rory" and his quaint habits
were well known and understood by every member
of the club.
</p>

<p>
On his side Mostyn was in no hurry to interrupt
the silence.  Everything that Sir Roderick had said
so far quite coincided with his own ideas.  He had
no wish whatever to run a horse for the next
year's Derby unless he was absolutely compelled
by the circumstance of forces to do so.
The fact was that he did not wish to oppose
Rada, Rada who had set her heart upon winning
that race.  True, she had in a way challenged
him&mdash;he remembered the words quite well,
for she had spoken them on the first occasion
of their meeting at Partinborough Grange: "I'm
only a girl, but I'll back myself to win the
Derby before you."  That's what she had said,
and later on, when she found that he had purchased
Castor she had jumped to the conclusion that he
had done so for the purpose of avenging himself
upon her&mdash;she, like everyone else, being ignorant
of his real motive.
</p>

<p>
For a little while he had felt that it would be
pleasant to enter into competition with her and to
beat her upon her own ground, but that was before
he had become convinced that he loved her; now
things appeared differently to him, and he desired
nothing more than that Rada should win her
cherished ambition; for himself he had to
concentrate his attention upon realising his legacy by
winning one of the other races that were open to
him, and, that done, he would still have four years
left him in which to find a Derby winner&mdash;no
light thing, of course&mdash;but then, his means
would be almost unlimited.  He felt that he
owed it to Royce's memory to attain this
end, quite as much as for the gratification of his
own self-esteem.
</p>

<p>
But he would not hurt Rada if he could help
it&mdash;that was the one thing upon which his
mind was made up.  There was no reason whatever,
as he looked at the position now, why they
should be opposed to each other.  The only
rivalry between them lay in the undoubted fact
that she had defied him to win the Derby within
five years, and he had quite made up his mind
to do so.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick looked up at last, and turned his
attention to his coffee, which had been growing
cold in front of him.  He began to stir it slowly
and reflectively with a long cigar cutter, which he
had taken up in mistake for his spoon, a mistake
over which he laughed heartily when Pierce hastened
to rectify it.
</p>

<p>
"It's not only in my speeches that I blunder,
apparently.  That's just what I am always doing in
the House," he pronounced, "stirring up things with
the wrong sort of spoon.  But the stirring gets done
all right, which is the main thing.  But now to
business," he went on, "and this is my advice to
you, Mostyn.  You tell me you are going to have
a shot for the Royal Hunt Cup, the first race open
to you; well, of course, you can do so if you
like, and there's no harm whatever in trying
your stride, but I can tell you right away
that you can't expect to do anything either
for the Hunt Cup or at Goodwood.  The time
is much too short.  After Goodwood I see you
have the Leger&mdash;" Sir Roderick was inspecting,
by means of one of the circular magnifying
glasses provided by the club, a written list of
the races which had been scheduled in Anthony
Royce's will.  "Well, as to the Leger," he
continued, "I really don't see that I can hold out
any hope for you there either.  You are not
likely to get a three-year-old capable of beating
either Hipponous or Peveril, and they are both
bound to run if fit.  So it's as clear as a pike-staff
to me that your best chance will be for the
Cesarewitch or the Cambridgeshire, and with
luck you might pull one of those races off.
Anyway I'll do what I can for you if you really
think my advice and assistance of any use&mdash;in
fact, I've already got an idea that I may be able
to secure a horse for you for the Cesarewitch; I
won't tell you its name just yet, however, but
you can take it from me that it will be a good
thing."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn was loud in his thanks, and before the
little party broke up that evening, he was as
confident of winning his legacy as if the money were
already in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye, my boy," Sir Roderick said,
when he rose to go&mdash;he always observed early
hours on those occasions when he was not
sitting late in Parliament.  "You've been set
a task that I envy you.  Go straight at it for
all you are worth, and don't be afraid of spending
your money&mdash;that's the safest way of putting it
in your pocket."
</p>

<p>
Of course, both Pierce and Mostyn laughed
heartily over this characteristic bull, an inversion
of ideas that had a sound basis of truth as far as
Mostyn was concerned.  It was perhaps significant
of the real interest that "Old Rory" was taking in
his subject that he had only perpetrated one bull
in the course of that evening.
</p>

<p>
Left alone, the two young men ordered whisky
and soda, and then they fell to discussing their
own more intimate affairs.  It may be assumed
that the names of Cicely and Rada&mdash;this in spite of
Pierce's eloquent discourse on worldly wisdom&mdash;were
repeated many times before the sitting came
to an end.  For now that Mostyn had come to town
there was no reason why he should not see his
sister; of course, he could not go to Bryanston
Square, but they might easily meet by appointment
somewhere else&mdash;say at Mostyn's rooms in Jermyn
Street.  And naturally, since Pierce was forbidden
to see Cicely, he was eager to hear all about her from
her brother.
</p>

<p>
"I don't see why you should scold me about
Rada," Mostyn smiled, when, a little before midnight,
he parted from his friend at the corner of Jermyn
Street, "you have spoken of nothing but Cicely for
the last hour, and I haven't been able to get in a
word edgeways."
</p>

<p>
"Cicely and I love each other," returned Pierce
thoughtlessly.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn reflected upon those words rather bitterly
as he walked slowly down Jermyn Street.  Yes, of
course, it was different&mdash;very different.  Pierce and
Cicely had been engaged, were presumably engaged
still, in spite of the year's probation that had been
imposed upon them.  At the end of that year,
whether further opposition were offered on the part
of John Clithero or not, the two young people would
come together again, and all would be well between
them.
</p>

<p>
How different it was with himself!  How
extraordinary that he should have fixed his
affections upon a girl with whom he could do
nothing but quarrel, who had made sport of
him in public, and who had declared that she
hated him.  What a fool he was, and how he wished
he could get the vision of Rada&mdash;Rada, with
her glossy and rebellious hair, and with her piercing
black eyes&mdash;out of his brain.  Rada, who had
called herself a devil when he had insisted that
she was an angel!
</p>

<p>
Well, it was a good thing that he had so much to
occupy his thoughts.  Pierce was right, and he
must give himself up wholly to the task before
him&mdash;he must leave Rada to Jack Treves, if it could
really be possible that she cared for the trainer's
son.  Rada was not for him.
</p>

<p>
He sighed heavily as he entered his room and
switched on the electric light.  A little pile of
letters awaited him upon the table, and topmost of
all was one addressed in a rather straggling, feminine
handwriting; Mostyn, taking it up curiously,
perceived that it bore the Partinborough postmark.
</p>

<p>
He knew at once, instinctively, that the letter
was from Rada herself&mdash;from Rada, whom he was
trying his best to forget.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN MAKES AN ENEMY.
</h3>

<p>
"I don't hate you!" Rada's letter began quite
abruptly.  "Indeed I don't, Mr. Clithero, and I
was a little beast to say I did, and I am writing to
you now because my conscience pricks me.  You
were very good&mdash;awfully good&mdash;to me about Castor,
and I am grateful to you, I really am.  I know
how you insisted on giving the colt back to my
father, and the terms you exacted from him.  I don't
believe you bought Castor out of any malice towards
me, and I only said so because I was in a temper
and couldn't control my tongue.  Then you would
insist upon my being an angel, a paragon of virtue,
when I was feeling myself a wicked little devil&mdash;and
that was silly of you, you know&mdash;you ought
to understand women better.
</p>

<p>
"But I feel I want to be friends with you,
Mr. Clithero, and that is why I am writing.  I haven't
got so many that I can afford to part with one.
We are rivals in a way, and since I have got Castor
back, I do think I stand the best chance of winning
the Derby first.  As far as that part of our bet
goes&mdash;since you will insist upon looking at it
as a bet&mdash;I have the advantage.  But, then,
it wasn't fair to you from the start.  I spoke,
knowing that I had got Castor, while you didn't
even know that I had registered my colours.
That was just like me, so I won't attempt to
excuse myself.
</p>

<p>
"But since you are so eager to win a Derby, and
prove me wrong in what I said upon the coach, I do
hope you will be successful.  You gave yourself
five years, you remember, so you need not grudge
me Castor next June.  Only I don't want you to
go on spending a lot of money over what was only,
after all, a silly speech.  Wouldn't it be better for
me to retract every word I said, and for us both to
forget all about it?"
</p>

<p>
"Poor Rada!" mused Mostyn, smiling as he read.
"She little knows, she little guesses why I have
taken up racing so keenly.  I wonder what she'll
say later on when she sees me throwing my money
about right and left&mdash;in order to put it in my
pocket, as 'Old Rory' would say.  She'll think
I'm doing it only out of bravado, and just because
I want to get even with her.  She'll think me a
silly young fool," he added, rather ruefully, "but
I can't help it if she does.  I won't tell the truth,
even to her, until I've succeeded in my task.
Then I don't mind who knows."
</p>

<p>
A few minutes ago Mostyn had been telling himself
that he must put Rada out of mind altogether;
now, as a consequence of her letter, he found himself
half unconsciously contemplating what he should
say to her upon their next meeting.
</p>

<p>
Their ways were not to lie so far apart, after all.
The girl did not hate him, and it was only his colossal
innocence which had made him think she did.
Mostyn was beginning to learn his lesson.
</p>

<p>
But there was Jack Treves.  Did she say anything
in her letter about Jack Treves?  With fingers that
trembled a little, he turned over the page, and there,
about half-way down, he espied the name of the
trainer's son.  After that he resumed his reading of
the letter at the place where he had left off, his
heart fluttering foolishly, the written words upon
the page dancing before his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"And now, just a few words on another subject,"
so the letter went on.  "It's a thing that I can
write better than I can speak&mdash;it's about Jack
Treves and that thousand pounds.  It's true I got
the money from him, and that there's a sort of
promise of marriage between us.  It's not only
because he helped me to buy back Castor, but
there has been a vague kind of understanding,
for the last year or two, that I am to marry
him some day.  My father wants it.  You'll
respect my confidence, I know, so I will tell you
that there's a considerable debt, and it must be
paid off somehow."
</p>

<p>
"The old blackguard!" commented Mostyn
forcibly, when he reached this point.  "He's selling
his daughter to pay off his debts&mdash;that's just what
it means.  But to sell her to a low-down bounder
like young Treves&mdash;it's cruel and disgusting.  And
she, I don't believe she cares for Treves a bit,
really, and she's probably angry with herself now
because she's bound the fetters all the tighter about
her by going to him in one of those tempestuous
tempers of hers and borrowing a thousand pounds.
A curse upon the money&mdash;if only Rada had taken
it back!"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had thrust the notes away in his safe at
the Grange that night, and there they had remained.
It was a foolish thing to have done, no doubt, but
he could not bring himself to touch the money&mdash;it
was like fire to his fingers.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn continued his reading.  "The truth is,
that I don't love anyone&mdash;at least, I don't think I
do.  It did not seem to me to matter if I married
Jack Treves or not.  He would do as well as
another&mdash;since I had to marry some day.  And just now
my mind is far too full of other matters&mdash;of Castor,
for instance, whom I think I love better than any
man upon earth&mdash;to think of marriage, or anything
of the sort.  Jack understands that, and he's
promised not to bother me till after the Derby next
year.  I like him for that; it's nice of him, don't
you think so?
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr. Clithero, I think I've explained
everything as well as I can.  You'll come back to the
Grange soon, won't you?  We'll be friends, and try
not to quarrel again."
</p>

<p>
It was with mingled feelings that Mostyn, having
read and re-read the letter, folded it up and thrust
it in his pocket.  The one point that stood out
clearly in his mind was that Rada did not really
love Jack Treves, although she had allowed herself
to drift into a sort of engagement with him.  Mostyn
could not flatter himself, from anything she said in
her letter, that she had any deeper feeling towards
himself; but, after all, there was no saying what
might happen in the course of the next year.  It was
very clear that, till after Castor had run in the
Derby, Rada did not want to be bothered&mdash;that
was her own expression&mdash;with questions of love
from him or from anyone else.
</p>

<p>
Well, no doubt it was all for the best.  He, himself,
had quite enough to occupy his attention till after
the next Derby was raced and won; in the meanwhile,
it was an excellent arrangement that he and
Rada should be good friends, and he would willingly
undertake, as Jack Treves had evidently undertaken,
not to "bother" her with any further suggestion
of his affection.  Ultimately, if she should care for
him better than for Jack&mdash;his lip curled derisively
at the mere idea of the comparison&mdash;well, there was
very little doubt that Captain Armitage would not
mind who married his daughter as long as his debts
were paid.
</p>

<p>
"I shall be something like a millionaire by then,
I hope," Mostyn muttered to himself, "so Master
Jack, if it's a question of money, I think I shall
stand a better chance than you."
</p>

<p>
With which reflection and a satisfied smile upon
his lips, Mostyn retired to bed.
</p>

<p>
"Well, all I can say is I hope you'll stick to the
arrangement of being just friends," Pierce grumbled
when, the next day, Mostyn told him of the letter
he had received, and how he had answered it&mdash;answered
it, perhaps, with a little more enthusiasm
than Pierce altogether cared for, explaining that
he was looking forward to the day when he could
return to Partinborough Grange.  This, however,
could not be for a week or so, Mostyn had
added, at any rate not till after Goodwood.
But the Cesarewitch was bound to bring him
to Newmarket.  "Just the race that's going to
mean so much for us," Pierce commented with
a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be afraid, old man," laughed Mostyn,
who was happier that day than Pierce had seen
him since his arrival in London&mdash;a bad omen,
the latter argued.  "I give you my word that
I'll put the Cesarewitch before everything else.
Rada doesn't want to be bothered, and I won't
bother her."
</p>

<p>
And with this promise Pierce was constrained to
be content.
</p>

<p>
The days passed, and, as they had anticipated,
their first essay&mdash;for the Royal Hunt Cup&mdash;met
with most indifferent success; they had, indeed,
been quite confident of failure long before the day
of the race.
</p>

<p>
The same fate befell them, just as "Old Rory"
had predicted, at Goodwood, and later on, at the
St. Leger.  The latter race cost Mostyn a good deal
of money.  The only animal that he had been able
to secure was a dark horse from the Manton stables,
which, for various reasons, could not be trained
earlier in the year, and was thought to have some
chance.  He proved an expensive bargain, and came
in with the ruck.  The actual race was, as had
been foretold, a struggle between Hipponous and
Peveril.  These two horses fought out their battle
a second time, and the Doncaster course suited
the chestnut even better than that of Epsom.
Once more Sir Roderick MacPhane secured a
victory.
</p>

<p>
These defeats having been anticipated, neither
Mostyn nor Pierce were in any way discouraged;
on the contrary, they were all agog with excitement,
for the day of the Cesarewitch was approaching,
and for this race they had secured a horse through
the kind offices of Sir Roderick, who had remembered
his promise, with which they hoped to do wonders.
</p>

<p>
Gulliver, the horse in question, came of an
irreproachable pedigree, and could already boast
of a good record.  He had run third the previous
year, and was only carrying seven pounds more
than on the former occasion.  Indeed, under the
training of old Treves, to whom Mostyn had
naturally sent him, Gulliver soon become a hot
favourite for the Cesarewitch.
</p>

<p>
Of course, by this time Mostyn and Rada had
met again, not once but many times.  Gulliver
being in the charge of Treves at Partinborough,
there was nothing to be wondered at in Mostyn
running up and down between London and his
country home.  Certainly his visits to the Grange
were brief, but then Pierce was always at his elbow
to hurry him away.  Mostyn sighed but obeyed.
His life seemed to be compounded of long railway
journeys all over the country; he had even been
dragged to Dublin for the Horse Show, and on
another occasion he had journeyed to Paris to view
some horses which had been particularly
recommended to him.
</p>

<p>
He was beginning to be talked about; the sporting
papers were taking notice of his name.  His face
had become a familiar one upon the racecourse.
A little later, unless he attained his object either
at the Cesarewitch or Cambridgeshire, he knew
quite well that he was bound to become an object
of general curiosity, a young man who was throwing
himself wildly into the track of the spendthrift,
the way many had gone before him, those who
foolishly dissipated fortunes on the Turf.  But
then, of course, the world did not know, and, after
all, it mattered very little to him what the world
should say.  Let it be clearly stated here that,
apart from his genuine love of sport, Mostyn took
no pleasure in the apparently reckless course to
which he was pledged.  He did not bet.  His
object was to achieve the task which had been set
him as quickly as possible, and then to take up the
position of the man who went in for racing reasonably,
with discretion and without the inordinate
passion of the gambler.
</p>

<p>
That John Clithero was already raging and
fuming over his son's growing notoriety, so much
Mostyn already knew.  He had seen Cicely on
several occasions soon after his first return to
London from Partinborough.  These meetings had
been a great pleasure to himself as well as to
the girl, as long as they could be continued,
but eventually, by some misfortune, John
Clithero obtained an inkling of them, and
summarily brought them to a conclusion by denying
his daughter the liberty which she had till then
enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Poor Cicely!  Mostyn thought her sadly changed
in those days.  She had always been a little shy
and nervous in manner, not very strong physically,
but now these peculiarities were so markedly
increased that Mostyn had asked her anxiously,
more than once, if she were sure that she were
not ill?
</p>

<p>
She had replied that there was nothing
amiss with her health, only that she was
not happy.  Could it be expected that she
should be happy?  Prevented from seeing her
lover, she was always torturing herself as to
what the end of it all would be.  Her
father was constantly telling her that she should
never marry Pierce, that he would see her in
her coffin first, and though Pierce had declared
to her, taking all his gods to witness that he
spoke the truth, that as soon as the year's
probation imposed upon him by his father had
passed, he would take her away from home
and cheerfully set John Clithero at defiance;
although over and over again Mostyn, inspired
by Pierce himself, would repeat this statement
to her, yet she always shook her fair head,
nervously clasping and unclasping her fingers, a
bright spot of colour rising ominously to the
centre of each pale cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Who can say what will happen in a year's
time?" she would murmur half under her breath.
"Our father is a strong man, Mostyn, and he has
always had his way.  I feel that he will have his
way with me."
</p>

<p>
No arguments that Mostyn could adduce had
any effect upon her, nor would she consent
to his suggestion that she should leave her
home and settle with him.  His idea was that
he could easily have installed her at Partinborough
Grange.
</p>

<p>
But again Cicely shook her head, though her
eyes glistened and became wet with tears at her
inability to accept.  The truth was that she was
afraid, and perhaps not without reason, for, if she
were free from her father's yoke, living under her
brother's care&mdash;her brother, who was so constantly
in the company of Pierce&mdash;well, then, the temptation
that both she herself and her lover would have
to endure might be more than their strength could
withstand.  They might meet, the probability was
that they would meet, and then Pierce would
want to set not only Mr. Clithero but his own
father as well at defiance.  And to do this would
mean his ruin: Cicely quite understood that, and
she was not going to allow him to run the risk.
It was wiser, far wiser, for her to endure her
life at home, almost unbearable though it was
becoming because of her father's ill-temper so
often directed against herself, and because of
the overbearing manner which both James and
Charles had adopted towards her: it was better
for her to put a brave face upon all this and
to wait till the year's probation had expired,
hoping against hope that all might be well in
the end.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, concerned as he was for his sister, had
seen the reason of her arguments, and he had
comforted her as best he could, assuring her of
Pierce's fidelity, and pointing out, adopting a tone
of levity that he did not feel, that some months
of the year had already passed, and that the rest
would go by quickly enough.  But all the same,
his heart bled for his sister, and he would have
liked nothing better than to have had a few minutes
uninterrupted conversation with those brothers of
his, James the Prig and Charles the Sneak; it
was against them that his animosity was chiefly
directed, for he knew that his father acted rightly
according to his lights; but as for the two
younger men&mdash;well, Mostyn had good reason to
mistrust them both.
</p>

<p>
He had explained to Cicely that his sudden
accession to wealth was due to a legacy bequeathed
to him by Anthony Royce; beyond this he had
entered into no particulars.  Let John Clithero
believe, as undoubtedly he would believe, that
his son had thrown himself into the world of
sport by his own inclination; Mostyn did not
care very much what interpretation might be
put upon his acts.  He had, indeed, been
more amused than annoyed when he was
approached by his father's solicitors with the
request that, if he must go racing and
squander good money, he should adopt another
name for the purpose.  This was only evidence
of the fact that Anthony Royce's subtle
revenge was already taking effect, and that John
Clithero was raging impotently at the fancied
degradation of his family honour.  Yet what had
happened so far was nothing to what might be
expected in the future: so Mostyn, a little irritated
by the tone adopted by the solicitors, had felt
bound to tell them.  His father had cast him off
cruelly and unjustly, and now Mostyn was his
own master, at liberty to face the world as seemed
best to him.
</p>

<p>
When Pierce learnt that the meetings of Mostyn
and Cicely had been prohibited he was furiously
angry, and it was all that Mostyn could do to
keep him from there and then proceeding to
Bryanston Square and summarily carrying Cicely
off.  But he calmed down after a time, and admitted
that the girl was right, that it was best not to
precipitate matters, nor to incur the anger of old
Mr. Trelawny.
</p>

<p>
"Although I must say," Pierce grumbled, "as
I have said before, that I can't make my governor
out.  He was loud in his praises of you for having
struck out your own course, but if I went and
did the same thing&mdash;well"&mdash;Pierce shrugged his
shoulders disconsolately&mdash;"I believe that Cicely
and I might beg our bread for all that he'd
care."
</p>

<p>
So matters stood when Mostyn and Pierce took
up their residence at Partinborough Grange some
ten days before the Newmarket meeting.  The
house had been thoroughly put in order, and was
now as comfortable a residence as anyone could
desire.  As for the garden, this had become, under
the careful auspices of Willis&mdash;who had now someone
to work for&mdash;a very floral paradise.  Perhaps it
was for the sake of Rada that Mostyn had given
special care to the cultivation of roses; he knew
how she loved the flower, and how they had
attracted her to the Grange before he came.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn and Rada met almost daily, but they
met as good friends, nothing more.  Pierce could
have had no possible reasons for grumbling.
Mostyn had quite made up his mind that the girl
must not be bothered by his attentions, and she
herself seemed to appreciate his decision, for she
never referred in any way to that explanatory
letter which she had written to London.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had no particular reason to be jealous of
Jack Treves, in spite of the understanding which
he knew existed between the girl and the trainer's
son.  Rada showed herself, as far as she could, to
be impartial, and her one desire during these days
seemed to be to avoid, as far as she could, any
reference to love or marriage: Castor was her
one care.
</p>

<p>
Certainly Mostyn was not jealous, nor did he
ever attempt, by word or deed, to belittle Jack
Treves in Rada's eyes&mdash;this though not infrequently
she would appeal to him for his opinion as to this
or that in the behaviour of Jack.  He had fully
made up his mind that he would hold himself
quite neutral and await events&mdash;the crisis that
would have to come after the following year's
Derby.
</p>

<p>
But as for Jack Treves, he did not look upon
matters quite in the same light, and when trouble
came it was due wholly to his jealousy, for he had
quite decided that he had cause to be jealous.
Thus it was that he was the first to break the
stipulation about not bothering Rada, and she, in
revenge, retaliated by cutting him for days together
and allowing herself to be more than ever in the
company of Mostyn.  Of all this the latter knew
nothing until, as was to be expected, the storm
broke.
</p>

<p>
It was two or three days before the Cesarewitch
and Mostyn had strolled over to the stables to have
a look at Gulliver after he was brought in from
exercise.  He was strolling leisurely across the
stretch of open country towards the gates when he
was suddenly confronted by Rada, emerging flushed
and excited, her lips pursed angrily together, her
eyes glittering with that look of irresponsible
defiance which Mostyn had already grown to
recognise, though of late it had not been directed
against himself.
</p>

<p>
Nor could it be so on the present occasion; he
was quite sure of that, for it was more than
a fortnight since he and Rada had had anything
approaching a quarrel, and then it had been merely
over some trivial matter quickly forgotten.  The
girl would have passed him with a little quick nod
of her head, but he held out his arm and impeded
her.
</p>

<p>
"What's up, Rada; what's wrong?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
At first she would give him no explanation at all;
she begged him to let her go; her father was
expecting her at home, and she was in a hurry.
But Mostyn, although he knew it was at some
risk to himself, took her by the arm and quietly
demanded particulars.  He had grown in daring
of late.
</p>

<p>
"You must tell me, Rada," he said, "you really
must.  I insist."
</p>

<p>
She looked at him, startled.  It was the first time
that he had adopted a tone of command towards
her.  Perhaps in her heart she was not altogether
displeased, although for a few moments she was
inclined to resent his interference.
</p>

<p>
But the truth came out in the end.  She had
just had a scene with Jack Treves, and she was
furious with him, so she asserted, perfectly furious.
He had been worrying her, making her life wretched,
and now matters had come to a climax.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn did not guess that he was in any way
the cause of this, nor did Rada care to admit the
fact.  The trouble, however, on the present
occasion was more deeply seated.
</p>

<p>
It was due, in a great measure, to Daisy Simpson.
Jack had refused to break off his intimacy with
this young woman, even after his semi-engagement
to Rada had become generally known, with the
very natural result that tongues had wagged and
scandal been hinted at.  Daisy had finally put an
end to all this by taking her departure for London
with the avowed intention of going upon the stage.
</p>

<p>
Jack had raged furiously and unreasonably, nor
had he made any secret of his annoyance.  Since
there was no definite engagement, he argued,
between himself and Rada he was clearly justified
in maintaining his old friendship; if there was any
scandal about the matter it was the fault of Rada
and her ridiculous decree, a decree which placed him
in an absurd and quite anomalous position.  He
therefore demanded that the girl should consent to
her engagement to him being officially announced.
</p>

<p>
Such had been the cause of the trouble, and
Jack Treves had just been treated to a touch of
Rada's temper.  And, no doubt, to judge from
her flashing eyes and the contemptuous curve of her
lips, he had been badly worsted in the encounter.
</p>

<p>
Rada appeared somewhat relieved when she
had unbosomed herself of her troubles.  It was
something new for her to find a confidant; under
ordinary circumstances she would have gone
straight home, and there, never having been
accustomed to give way before her father or to
tell him anything of her doings, she would have
shut herself up in her own room to brood for hours
together, or she might have saddled her mare
and ridden away, just for the mere want of
sympathy, as she often did when Captain Armitage
happened to be in a particularly obnoxious frame
of mind, or muddled from drink, now more often
than ever the case.
</p>

<p>
These ideas flashed quickly through Mostyn's
brain as, awkwardly enough, he attempted to
speak words of consolation.  All his heart went out
in sympathy to the wayward girl.  How could it
be expected that Rada should be anything than
just what she had become?
</p>

<p>
"I won't have it announced to all the world
that some day I am going to be married to Jack,"
Rada cried, petulantly tapping the turf with an
impatient little foot.  "When I have said a thing
I mean to abide by it, and I told Jack that there
was to be no mention of any engagement between
us till after next June.  It's bad enough to think
that I've got to be married at all&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Rada, do you really care for Jack?"  The
words were upon Mostyn's tongue, but he did
not speak them.  He was quite certain that Rada
did not really care for Jack, but at the same time
he had no reason to believe that she cared any
better for himself.  And what danger of harming
himself in her eyes might he not be running if he
suggested anything of the sort?  Rada would
only have two men bothering her, as she expressed
it, instead of one.  Far better for him to
bide his time and let matters take their own
course.
</p>

<p>
Rada, of her own accord, made answer to the
unspoken question.  "I think I'm beginning to
hate him," she asserted.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn turned his head away and, despite himself,
his lips parted in a smile, for he understood
the words were spoken in temper and bore no
real significance.  Had she not said the same to
him?  And for the time being he had been fool
enough to believe it.
</p>

<p>
The truth was, so he told himself a little sadly,
after Rada had left him, that she cared for no one
at all.  It was the truth that she had written in
her letter.  But could she not grow to care?  She
had had so little of love in her life that, as yet,
she hardly knew the meaning of the word.
</p>

<p>
"You are very good to me," so she had said
when she left him that morning, refusing his
company on her way home: not that she would
not have been pleased to have it, but because she
knew his time was valuable.  "I'm glad that we
are friends, Mostyn"&mdash;she had come to call him
by his Christian name by now&mdash;"though I can't
see what there is in me for you to trouble yourself
about."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn would have liked to have told her there
and then, but once more discretion urged silence.
</p>

<p>
His adventures of that morning were, however,
not yet concluded, for before he turned in at the
stable gates he met Jack Treves himself lounging
heavily out, his hands thrust deep into the pockets
of his breeches, his cap tilted to one side of his
head, a cigarette thrust between his lips and carried
at an aggressive upward angle.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Treves," said Mostyn.  He
was always on terms of armed neutrality with the
trainer's son, and he affected to take no notice of
the scowls with which the latter usually met him,
and the scarcely veiled impertinence of the tone
which he was wont to adopt.  Mostyn had no
wish to quarrel with Jack Treves, mainly for
Rada's sake, but also because he had a sincere
respect for Jack's father, the rough, simple-minded,
and uneducated old trainer whom, nevertheless, he
recognised as a straightforward and honest man,
one who was serving him faithfully, and who was
doing his utmost to ensure Gulliver's victory.
</p>

<p>
Jack came to a halt, standing aggressively
between Mostyn and the stable gates.  He drew
his hands from his pockets, removed the cigarette
from between his lips and blew out a cloud of
smoke&mdash;smoke the odour of which fell offensively
upon Mostyn's nostrils.  Jack's fancy in tobacco
was not of the most refined order.
</p>

<p>
"I saw you talkin' to Rada just now," he said.
"Been tryin' to comfort her, I suppose, because
I thought it time to have my say?  A nice sort of
comforter you are!"  There was a vicious sneer
upon his lips.  "Look here," he went on, taking
a menacing step forward and dropping the tone
of sarcasm which he had not the wit to maintain,
"what do you mean by it?"
</p>

<p>
"Please explain yourself."  Mostyn spoke very
quietly; on such occasions he never lost his temper,
and always held himself under complete control.
His calmness galled his adversary.
</p>

<p>
"You know jolly well what I mean.  You're
always hanging about Rada, and ever since you've
been here you've tried to make mischief between
us.  Well, I'm not going to have it; I tell you
that straight."
</p>

<p>
The young man's words were liberally intersected
with oaths.
</p>

<p>
"You're labouring under a delusion," Mostyn
said; then he too advanced a step, as if to indicate
that he had had enough of Jack's company.
</p>

<p>
But the latter, already goaded into a passion
by Rada, appeared anxious to vent some of it
upon Mostyn.  He was not lacking in pluck, so
much can be said for him, for he was in truth the
smaller and sparer man of the two.  Mostyn, with
his splendid physique, might well have warned
him to think twice before he ventured, as he
actually did, to break out with a string of invectives
and foul words.  He had quite a remarkable
vocabulary at his disposition.
</p>

<p>
Even then Mostyn did not lose his temper,
recognising that Jack Treves was in a rage and
not responsible for what he said.
</p>

<p>
"You're a silly fellow, Treves," he remarked
with perfect composure, "and a foul-mouthed one
at that.  Just stand out of my way, please, and
let me pass.  I've some business to talk over with
your father."
</p>

<p>
As he spoke he raised his arm to thrust Jack
aside.  But this was too much for the latter; the
idea that he should be treated with this calm
disdain, his protest simply ignored, and he himself
pushed aside as if he were of no account whatever,
all this caused him completely to lose control of
himself..  He threw himself blindly upon Mostyn
and struck out wildly, not as he would have done
in calmer moments, for, as a matter of fact, lie
rather fancied himself upon his pugilistic
powers.
</p>

<p>
The next moment the natural result came about.
Mostyn, forced to it against his will, retaliated
with a well-directed blow, and Jack Treves
measured his length upon the ground.  The fight,
if fight it could be called, was very soon at an
end, for Jack showed no further inclination to
renew the combat.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry if I hurt you, Treves," Mostyn
remarked, as his late adversary sat up and dabbed
a handkerchief to his damaged face.  "But really,
you know, if you have anything to say you should
be a little more careful in the way you say it."  With
which Mostyn passed on.  The matter was
concluded as far as he was concerned.
</p>

<p>
But Jack Treves, behind him, scrambled to his
feet.  His lip was cut and the blood was trickling
down his chin.  There was blood in his mouth
too, and he spat it out as once more a volume
of oaths escaped him.
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash; you, Mostyn Clithero!" he cried, safely
now, for the object of his hatred was well out
of ear-shot.  "You haven't downed me for nothing,
I can tell you that.  I'll be even with you some
day, you mark my words!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN FACES DEFEAT.
</h3>

<p>
"Pierce, old man, I'm afraid we are going to
be beaten."  Mostyn pushed his chair back from
the dinner table, lit a cigarette and disconsolately
watched the little rings of smoke which he blew
in quick succession from his lips.
</p>

<p>
The two friends were seated in the dining-room
of the Grange, and they had just partaken of
a good dinner, which had been well served up by
a quiet man-servant, who had been in Mostyn's
service for the last eight months.
</p>

<p>
The winter, following a series of reverses, had
come and gone, and now, though the prescribed
year had nearly elapsed, Mostyn found himself
apparently as far as ever from successfully carrying
out the terms of his bequest.
</p>

<p>
On the following day the Two Thousand Guineas
would be run, then there was the Thousand; after
that there remained the Derby and the Oaks&mdash;and
that was all.
</p>

<p>
Pierce stared straight at the wine-glass which he
had just filled with fine old port, of which Mostyn
had found a good supply in his cellar.  He had
little to say by way of comfort.
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid Asmodeus will go down, like the
rest of them," he muttered.  "He hasn't an
earthly chance against Don Quixote.  And then
there's Bouncing Boy."
</p>

<p>
"Bouncing Boy won't win either," commented
Mostyn.  He was very proficient in racing by now,
an excellent judge of winning form.  He had
formulated quite a theory in his own mind of
horses for courses, but whenever he tried to buy
a good horse that had already won a big handicap
he was always met by difficulties in the way of
refusal to sell.  "Don Quixote will win, and win
easily.  Asmodeus may be second, but what's
the use of that to me?" he added.  "I'm sick of
horses that are placed second."
</p>

<p>
Herein, indeed, was disclosed much of the irony
of the whole position.  Three times in quick
succession on the flat Mostyn's horses had been
accorded the second place, which was palpably
no use to him whatever.  The Lincolnshire, the
Chester Cup, and the City and Suburban&mdash;in all
three of these races Mostyn's horses had come in
second.
</p>

<p>
"We've done our best," commented Pierce,
after a moment's pause; "at least there's
that to be said.  But it was too hard a task,
Mostyn: Anthony Royce made it too stiff for
you."
</p>

<p>
"At any rate he obtained what he wanted."  Mostyn
looked up with a quaint smile.  "He
steeped me in racing and he made my father wild;
he got his revenge right enough.  The papers are
always advertising my name.  It is 'Mr. Clithero,
that ubiquitous young sportsman, has purchased
so and so'; or 'Mr. Clithero, the irrepressible, will
run so and so for such a race.'  They write articles
about me, comment on my not betting, on my
personal appearance, and all the rest of it.  I've
seen my portrait in the papers till I'm sick of the
sight of it.  Some call me plucky; others laugh
at me for my folly and think I'm just a wild young
spendthrift.  My father sees all those papers;
Cicely tells me in her letters that he has
them sent to him.  He must simply rage with
fury.  That's just what Royce wanted.  You
remember how my father tried, through the
solicitors, to put a stop to my racing under my
own name?"
</p>

<p>
Pierce nodded.  The mention of Cicely had set
up a new train of thought in his mind; he heard
what was said without paying particular heed to it.
</p>

<p>
"Of course I couldn't do that," Mostyn went
on; "and my refusal must have made the poor
old man more angry than ever, and I expect the
very idea that I had been left money by Anthony
Royce, his enemy, must have driven him half
crazy."
</p>

<p>
"He's making things almost impossible at home,"
put in Pierce, following his own thoughts.  "You
know how Cicely, poor child, writes of him.  His
temper is abominable, and she always has to bear
the brunt of it.  Cicely hardly dare send you a
letter now because she is accused of abetting you
in your misdeeds."  Pierce frowned and kicked
viciously at the leg of the table.  "And then,
hasn't he threatened to turn her out of the house
unless she will consent to promise never to marry
me?  Oh!  I tell you, Mostyn, her life must be a
hell, a hell!"  He rose and promenaded the room
with long strides.
</p>

<p>
Cicely's relations with her father were perhaps
even worse than Pierce was aware of.  She had
written long letters to Mostyn&mdash;though of late he
had guessed, from the rarity with which she wrote,
that her correspondence had been placed under
surveillance&mdash;and had poured out her heart to
him.  She had begged him, however, to observe
discretion with Pierce, fearing to cause the latter
unnecessary trouble.  She was still convinced that
she must hold out till the end of the year, but it
was hard, very hard, to do so.
</p>

<p>
The chief cause of offence was her constancy to
her lover.  She steadily refused to give him up,
even though, day after day, John Clithero poured
out upon her the vials of his wrath.  The smallest
word would lead to a scene, and she had no one
to turn to for comfort, for both her brothers were
united against her.
</p>

<p>
"Go and join Mostyn, the profligate," John
Clithero would cry, lifting his fists in impotent
rage.  "You are children of Belial, chaff for the
burning.  My sin is upon me, that I have begotten
such as you!"
</p>

<p>
Knowing of these scenes, Pierce had gone to his
father and again begged to be allowed to take
Cicely away at once; but the old man had relented
nothing of his stubbornness, though when he
spoke of the year's probation which he had
imposed upon his son, there was always that
queer look upon his face which Pierce could not
understand.
</p>

<p>
"Don't let's worry our heads over these things
to-night, old chap," Mostyn said at last.
"To-morrow's the Guineas&mdash;another step in my
progress.  Come and sit down, and let's talk over
our chances."
</p>

<p>
After a few more rapid strides up and down,
Pierce adopted the suggestion, and soon, for the
time being, he had forgotten his own troubles in
fighting anew with Mostyn their past battles, in
preparing a brave face for what was still to come.
</p>

<p>
There was not one race out of all those scheduled
in the will which Mostyn had neglected.  He had
thrown himself, heart and soul, into his task.
Pierce, with his better knowledge of the Turf, had
ably advised and seconded him.
</p>

<p>
In so many instances they had come near to
victory&mdash;that was the heart-rending part of it all.
Success had seemed within their grasp, only to
be snatched away at the last moment.
</p>

<p>
The Cesarewitch&mdash;that had perhaps been the
greatest disappointment of all.  A horse like
Gulliver, with his pedigree and his record, hot
favourite, too, as he had been made&mdash;Mostyn and
Pierce had indeed been justified in their belief
that with Gulliver their great object would be
achieved.
</p>

<p>
But Gulliver failed, and that apparently by
sheer ill-luck.  How clearly all the particulars
were engraved upon Mostyn's brain!  The bad
news had come to him&mdash;the news that forecasted
the failure that was to follow&mdash;a couple of days
before the race, and almost immediately after the
short, sharp tussle which he had had with Jack
Treves outside the gates of the stables.  He had
found the trainer awaiting him, an ominous yellow
paper in his hand, an expression of keen anxiety
upon his honest face.
</p>

<p>
"I'm sorry, sir, upon my word, I'm as sorry
as if the affair were my own."  Thus had spoken
the blunt old man.
</p>

<p>
"What's up, Treves?" Mostyn had asked, a
sense of misgiving seizing upon him.  Old Treves
would not have looked so worried without a real
cause.
</p>

<p>
The latter handed over the telegram without
another word, and Mostyn realised what had
happened.  The jockey who was to have ridden
Gulliver&mdash;none other than the redoubtable Fred
Martin himself, the same who had steered Hipponous
to victory at the Derby&mdash;Fred Martin had been
taken ill, was lying in hospital, and had been
forced now, at the eleventh hour, to throw up
the sponge.
</p>

<p>
"It's all true, sir," Treves said, as if he had
an idea that Mostyn might have doubted the
genuineness of the story.  "I'd stake my life
that Fred Martin wouldn't give up unless he was
forced&mdash;the lad's as straight as they make 'em."
</p>

<p>
The blow was irreparable, and Mostyn realised
it at once.  At such short notice it was practically
impossible to find an adequate substitute, and
the jockey who finally rode Gulliver, a mere boy,
proved himself unequal to the task.  The horse
was bad-tempered, and realised at once that a
stranger was on his back.  He made a bad start,
and, though he picked up afterwards, only succeeded
in running into third place.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, who had felt that with Gulliver the
game was in his hands, was terribly cast
down; but there was, luckily perhaps, no time
for serious reflection.  The Cambridgeshire followed
on so quickly, and here again, all his plans
having been carefully laid, he stood a very
fair chance.
</p>

<p>
When the weights for the Cambridgeshire had
been announced, it was found that Silver Star, the
property of a well-known nobleman, had been
treated most leniently by the handicappers.  The
mare at once became a raging-hot favourite, and
Mostyn spared no expense in his endeavours to
purchase her.  The noble owner was by no means
inclined to sell, but, finally&mdash;and here again
Mostyn had to thank Sir Roderick for his
good offices&mdash;the deal was carried through,
though it made a terrible inroad into Mostyn's
diminishing capital.
</p>

<p>
But the day before the race, just when she was
about to be transferred from Treves's stables to
Newmarket, Silver Star was found to be ailing.
There were suspicious circumstances about the
case, too, for the horse's illness was so very sudden
and unexpected, also it appeared difficult to diagnose
the actual cause of the trouble.  On the other hand,
it was impossible to throw suspicion upon anyone.
Had Jack Treves been at home, Mostyn might
have felt interested in his movements at that time,
but Jack had been sent away by his father to
purchase horses in another part of the country,
and so, as far as Silver Star was concerned, he
seemed beyond suspicion.
</p>

<p>
It was due to the discretion of old Treves himself
that Jack had been sent away.  The trainer had
learnt of the assault upon Mostyn, and had
immediately taken vigorous and characteristic
action.  He had not spared his son, but had
rebuked him in round and unmeasured terms,
both for his treatment of Rada&mdash;having
regard to his philandering with Daisy Simpson&mdash;and
for his utter folly in risking the making
of bad blood between his father and his father's
best client.
</p>

<p>
Old Mr. Treves had every wish to see the
engagement between Jack and Rada a settled thing;
having made money himself, he was now anxious
that his son should raise himself in the social scale.
But, from his point of view, Jack was busily engaged
in spoiling his best chances.
</p>

<p>
"Mark my words," he said, "you will lose the
girl altogether if ye don't treat her as a real
lady&mdash;which she is.  Daisy Simpson, indeed!"&mdash;the old
man sniffed indignantly&mdash;"carrying on with a
drab like that!  Why, you are just askin' to get
the chuck, that's what you're doin'&mdash;askin' for
it."  Here his indignation almost overpowered
him.  "It's a good thing you caught it from
Mr. Clithero," he went on, "an' wot you got served
you right.  If you hadn't been punished already,
I've a mind to hide you myself&mdash;yes, to take the
stick to you, as I did when you was a lad&mdash;what's
more, I could do it, too!"
</p>

<p>
Old Treves was bulky, broad of shoulder, and in
rude health; as father and son stood there together
it looked very much as if the elder man could easily
have carried his words into effect.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway, you shan't be hangin' about the
place, making a nuisance of yourself, more'n I can
help till after next June.  Miss Rada shall have the
clear run she wants, and I expect the less she sees
of you, in the meanwhile, the more she'll be likely
to take to you in the end."
</p>

<p>
It was, as a consequence of this, that Jack,
despite his grumbles and the consciousness that
he was giving a clear field to his rival, was packed
off from Partinborough, and troubled Mostyn and
Rada very little more during the months that
ensued.
</p>

<p>
Silver Star was scratched for the Cambridgeshire,
and so Mostyn's last hope for that year expired.
He had now some four months to wait in which to
make his preparations for the big steeplechase in
the following March, as well as for the Lincolnshire.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had taken no advantage of Jack's
summary dismissal from Partinborough.  He was,
indeed, only on and off at the Grange, finding
that he had plenty to occupy him in London.  He
had taken up a definite position with regard to
Rada, and he was resolved to adhere firmly to it.
She knew he loved her; it was for her to choose,
when the time came, between him and Jack.  She
could break off her semi-engagement to the latter
if she pleased; should Castor win the Derby, she
would certainly have the means of paying off her
debt; besides, apart from this, she was already
making money with her horse, whose record was
as yet unbroken.  Castor had won everything for
which he had been entered.  Then there was the
thousand pounds still reposing in Mostyn's safe&mdash;this
money was quite at her disposition if her pride
would allow her to take it.  All this Mostyn had
told her.  So it was for Rada to choose.  Mostyn
would not speak of his love, he would not "bother"
her.  They met constantly, they teased each other,
they quarrelled now and then&mdash;always making
peace very quickly&mdash;and there were times when
Mostyn thought that the eyes of the girl were
wistful, times when he could not help fancying
that she would show no bitter resentment if he
opened his arms to take her to them, as he had
done once before.
</p>

<p>
In his way he was stubborn, stubborn in his
determination to abide by the conditions he had
imposed upon himself.  It was true that he did
not understand women, and Rada was, of course,
a particularly complex study.  "I'll wait till after
the Derby," so he told himself over and over again.
"Rada wants no talk of love till then; has she
not said so?"  He often wondered why Rada
should sometimes be cross with him without a
cause; and once&mdash;he remembered quite well&mdash;she
had burst into tears and run away; it was just
before he left Partinborough for a longer stay than
usual in town.
</p>

<p>
All this while, although, so far, failure had befallen
him, there was not the smallest doubt in his
mind that he would ultimately be successful
in carrying out the terms of Anthony Royce's
bequest.
</p>

<p>
But a fresh series of failures awaited him at
the opening of the season.  The Lincolnshire&mdash;that
was the first of the three races in which his
horse had run into second place; then had followed
the Grand National, and here, having successfully
negotiated Beecher's Brook and Valentine's Brook
on the first round, Mostyn's mare, Giralda, had
come badly to grief upon the second round; both
jockey and mare were injured, the latter so much
so that she had then and there to be shot.
</p>

<p>
The Chester Cup&mdash;second again; and finally, the
City and Suburban, with exactly the same result.
</p>

<p>
Now there remained Asmodeus, who was second
favourite for the Two Thousand Guineas, and a
filly for the Thousand, whose training, however,
had been insufficient for Mostyn to place much
reliance upon her.  She might possibly do better
for the Oaks&mdash;absolutely Mostyn's last chance&mdash;but
even with regard to this he had little confidence.
For a long while he had steadily refused to have
anything to do with the Derby, and so valuable
time had been lost.  Now he had a colt named
Cipher in training, but Cipher was not a patch
upon either Castor or upon Sir Roger's Pollux, and
could hardly be looked upon as standing a
chance.  Such was the present position, and,
considering it squarely and without bias, both
Mostyn and Pierce had to admit that it was a
desperate one.
</p>

<p>
"That beast of a Jew, Isaacson, will carry off
the Two Thousand," groaned Pierce.  "Don Quixote
is bound to win on his form.  We shall be in for
another second.  The only thing is, that we've got
a better man up.  Stanhope is a fine jockey, while
Wilson is a fellow whom I never trusted, and they
speak badly of him in the ring.  But I expect
he's being well paid for his job."
</p>

<p>
Isaacson, the owner of Don Quixote, was the
same man whose horse, Peveril, had so nearly
won the Derby against Hipponous.  He had only
made his appearance upon the Turf within the
last year or so, since some successful speculation
had brought him a fortune.  The only good point
about him, so Pierce was wont to aver, was that
he had not shown himself ashamed of his name,
or of the method by which he had earned his living.
He had been a bill discounter and money lender
upon rather a large scale, and though he was reputed
hard, no imputation had ever been made upon his
honesty.  Since wealth had come to him, he had
given away large sums in charity, but this was
probably in order that he might win the popularity
which he coveted.  He liked to make a big show,
and his racing colours were all gold.
</p>

<p>
After a while Pierce rose, yawned, and expressed
his determination to go to bed.  The two young
men had dined late, and their discussion had been
a prolonged one.  "Good-night, old chap," he said,
"and don't worry your mind more than you
can help.  Things may come all right, after all.
Asmodeus is a good horse, and there are a lot who
fancy him."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn looked up brightly as he nodded good-night.
"Oh, I'm not worrying!" he said, "the
whole thing has been a gamble, hasn't it, Pierce?
And he's a poor gambler who growls at his losses."
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS TEMPTED.
</h3>

<p>
Left alone, Mostyn drew his arm-chair nearer the
fire, and settling himself comfortably, gave himself
up to solitary reflection.  The evenings were still
fresh, for May had set in unseasonably, and a fire
was by no means to be despised.  It was, indeed,
because the dining-room was the warmer of the
two sitting-rooms that Mostyn had elected to
occupy it that evening.  Frazer, the man-servant,
had long ago cleared the table, and so Mostyn
did not expect to be disturbed.
</p>

<p>
Of course, as was only natural, his thoughts
turned to Rada.  And now, as he sat gazing into
the fire, he knew that he had been very dense.
That foolish stubbornness of his&mdash;it was there that
the blame lay.  He had made up his mind that
Rada's injunction was to be obeyed strictly and
to the letter, and so he had put temptation behind
him, even when his common-sense, combined with
his racing experience, told him that the time had
come to force the pace.
</p>

<p>
He had refrained from speaking, although, over
and over again, he had read invitation in Rada's
eyes; he had given his word to her, he had given
his word to Pierce; besides, Rada's semi-engagement
to Jack Treves was still an accepted fact, and so
Mostyn argued that until she, voluntarily and of
her own accord, elected to break with Jack, he
had no right to interfere.  He had never doubted
that she would do this after the Derby, when
the question of a formal engagement was to
be raised.
</p>

<p>
Of course, there was much overstraining at honour
in all this, as well as a lamentable ignorance of
the feminine nature; but then that was Mostyn
all over.  He did not&mdash;in this case, it was almost
would not&mdash;take into account the possibility, the
inherent probability, of a woman changing her
mind.  He was quite aware that Rada's moods
were as variable as those of the proverbial April
day, and yet he insisted upon taking her literally,
with the natural result that his attitude was sorely
misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
For Rada had come to the conclusion that his
feelings towards her had undergone a change&mdash;that
he no longer cared&mdash;and she was miserable in
consequence.  Mostyn had been aware of this
fact for some little time past; he was now only
too conscious of all that he had left undone.  He
would have asked nothing better than to go to Rada
and speak out his love; it was no longer stubbornness
and a straining at honour that hindered
him.  It was something more potent than
that.
</p>

<p>
For, now that all might have been well, another
factor in the case had arisen, another opponent
had sprung into being, and poor Mostyn was
beginning to realise that he was beaten all
along the line.  Rada was further away from
him than ever just when she seemed to be most
near.
</p>

<p>
Ruin stared him in the face&mdash;irrevocable ruin.
He was a failure&mdash;Anthony Royce's millions would
never be his.  In another month's time he would
be plunged back into poverty&mdash;he would have
nothing left, nothing save the Grange, which he
would not be able to keep up.  All the ready money
which had been handed over to him had been
expended&mdash;he had even the possibility of debts
to face.
</p>

<p>
For himself he did not care&mdash;he had had his
sporting chance and fate had been against him.
The world would say that there was another young
spendthrift gone under; his father and his brothers,
not knowing the truth, would have some excuse
for pointing the finger of scorn at him; but these
things troubled him little.  He would fight for
himself, as he had meant to fight before he had
known of Royce's bequest.
</p>

<p>
If it were not for Rada&mdash;Rada whom he loved so
passionately!  How could he ask her to share his
poverty?  The thing was impossible&mdash;he had
realised the impossibility of it for some weeks
past&mdash;just as the truth of her love for him was
filtering into his brain.  How tragically ironical it
all was!
</p>

<p>
"Asmodeus won't win the Guineas," he muttered
to himself, disconsolately enough, since there
was none present before whom he must keep up
the farce of cheerfulness.  "And as for the filly,
she is quite hopeless.  So what remains?  Only
the Derby, and that I should have to fight out
against Rada.  I don't know that I would win it
from her, even if I could.  But I can't, so there's
an end of it.  There's an end to everything, so far
as I can see&mdash;to fortune, to ambition, to love&mdash;yes,
jolly well an end to everything.  That's what
I see in the future."
</p>

<p>
He could see no brighter picture by staring into
the dying fire, and presently he rose with a sigh
and a yawn, preparatory to making his way upstairs
to bed.  It was at that moment that he heard
the front door bell ring, and a minute or so
later the sedate Frazer put in an appearance
and announced that there was a man, who
had not given his name but who looked like a
stable-man, who wished to see Mostyn upon
urgent business.
</p>

<p>
"It's not Stanhope, Frazer?" asked Mostyn
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," Frazer shook his head decidedly; he
knew Stanhope by sight quite well.  "I've not
seen the fellow before," he added.  "He's never
been to the house, I'm quite sure of that."
</p>

<p>
"Show him in here, Frazer," Mostyn commanded.
"I'll see him, whoever he is."
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, after a brief interval, the stranger
was admitted.  He stood in the doorway fidgetting
from one foot to the other, his cap in his hand,
his tightly-fitting coat buttoned close over his
chest.  The buttons were big and flashy; the man's
general appearance&mdash;his expression as well as his
attire&mdash;was unprepossessing.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn recognised him at once, and wondered
what on earth he had come for.  He waited, however,
till Frazer had withdrawn, till the door was
closed upon them both.
</p>

<p>
"You are Wilson," he said then, "Ted Wilson,
the jockey.  Why do you want to see me, and
at this hour of the night?"
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't come afore, sir," Wilson shifted
from one foot to the other in an undecided sort
of manner.  He had little twinkling eyes, and
sandy hair brushed over his forehead in a carefully
oiled curl.  He had yellow teeth, which protruded
like a rabbit's, and a weak, receding chin; he was
a clever jockey, which is about as much as could
be said in his favour.
</p>

<p>
"I couldn't come afore becos the guv'nor
wouldn't let me out of his sight.  He's a jolly
sharp 'un, is David Isaacson, I give you my
word."
</p>

<p>
"Well, what's your object in coming to see
me?" repeated Mostyn rather sharply.  He
neither liked the man himself, nor did he care
for this intercourse with one of the servants of
his rival.
</p>

<p>
Wilson took a few steps forward into the room
and seated himself, without being invited to do so,
upon the very edge of the most unpretentious-looking
chair that he could pick out.  "I want a
word with you, private like," he said in a hoarse,
throaty voice.  His eyes rested nervously upon the
spirit tantalus in its place on the sideboard.  He
had, perhaps wittingly, seated himself in close
proximity to it.
</p>

<p>
"I've walked across from the Crathorn Stables,"
he said pleadingly, "an' I can tell you it's dry
work."  The Crathorn Stables were those at which
Don Quixote had been lodged, and they were
distant, as Mostyn knew, a good half-dozen miles
in the direction of Newmarket.
</p>

<p>
"You can help yourself.  You'll find a tumbler
close beside you, and there's whisky in the stand."  The
jockey did not await a second invitation, but
helped himself largely to the spirit, adding to it
a very small quantity of water.
</p>

<p>
"That's better," he said, as he tossed off the
spirit.  "Now we can tork."
</p>

<p>
"I'm waiting," said Mostyn drily.
</p>

<p>
"Well, it's like this," said the jockey, fixing his
little eyes upon Mostyn as though attempting to
read his thoughts.  "I've had a row with the
guv'nor; he's a rotter, that's wot he is!"  He
paused meaningly.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn gave him no assistance.  "Well?" was
all he said.
</p>

<p>
"A rotter," repeated Wilson, "a low-down,
measly Jew.  I've never ridden for a Jew afore,
an' I'm sorry I consented to this time."
</p>

<p>
"Well?" repeated Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
"Carn't you see wot I'm drivin' at, Mr. Clithero?
Carn't you help a chap a bit?" protested Wilson,
who thought that the object of his visit should have
been guessed at once.
</p>

<p>
"Hadn't you better speak clearly, and come to
the point?" suggested Mostyn, who had a pretty
shrewd idea of what was about to be proposed
to him.
</p>

<p>
Wilson accordingly made the plunge.  "Don
Quixote is goin' to win the Two Thousand," he
said.  "Asmodeus ain't.  There's no getting round
that to us as knows; that is, of course, if all goes
normal like.  Well, Mr. Clithero, sir, I guess you
want to win this race, and that's why I've come to
you, Mr. Clithero, sir."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn hated the constant repetition of his name,
and he was boiling over with indignation at the
suggestion made to him, though he kept his features
under control, and allowed the little man to have
his say.
</p>

<p>
To the jockey it seemed that the owner of
Asmodeus must be particularly dense.  He did not
like to put his proposition into plain words.  What
was the necessity for it?
</p>

<p>
"Between man and man who understand each
other," he began, "these little things can be
arranged, you know."  He rose from his chair,
putting his empty glass aside, and sidled nearer
to Mostyn.  "I'm ready to strike a bargain with
you, Mr. Clithero, sir, if so be ye're willing.  It
needn't be such a dead cert for Don Quixote, after
all."  Mostyn sat silent, staring straight before
him, though he kept one elbow well out in order
to prevent Wilson coming too near.  Of course,
he knew quite well what was meant&mdash;had understood
all the time.  This little rogue was willing
to pull Don Quixote for a consideration&mdash;a
consideration which, though no doubt it would be
heavy, Mostyn was quite capable of providing, and,
as far as he was concerned, there was no actual
danger.  If any objection were raised to the
riding&mdash;which was most unlikely, for Wilson
was clever at that sort of thing&mdash;it would all
be put down to a manoeuvre on the part of
Isaacson, or to spite on the part of the
jockey&mdash;as far as Mostyn was concerned, it didn't
matter which.
</p>

<p>
The boy's face was burning, the blood coursing
quickly through his veins, his heart beating quickly.
A few moments ago, when he had first realised
what was being proposed to him, his inclination
had been to get up, to take the jockey by the
scruff of his neck, and throw him out without
more ado; then, suddenly, and as if someone
had whispered in his ear, a temptation, such as
he had never known before in his life, had come
upon him.
</p>

<p>
There was so much at stake for him&mdash;so vast
a sum of money, which seemed about to slip
through his fingers.  And there was Rada, too.
If Asmodeus should win this race, why, all
might still be well.  He would not be a beggar
in another month's time, and then, what was
there to prevent him going to Rada and
saying: "You love me&mdash;you don't love Jack
Treves&mdash;I want you, Rada, and mean to have
you!"  He was sure&mdash;at that moment&mdash;that she
would fall into his arms, and that he had only
to speak.  All this&mdash;success, wealth, love&mdash;might
be his, if Asmodeus won.  At that moment, sharper
than ever, he felt the bitter sting of defeat.  "There
is no other way," whispered the insinuating voice
in his ear.  "You'd much better accept a good
offer when it's made to you."
</p>

<p>
"It's a fair deal I'm proposin' to you, Mr. Clithero,
sir," muttered the jockey, his voice seeming to
harmonise and blend with that of the imaginary
tempter.  "I can do it easy as easy, and who
wants a beastly Jew to win?  You can back
Asmodeus for all you like&mdash;put your shirt on
'im&mdash;for if we get to understand each other
he's bound to win, there ain't another horse in
the race.  It'll be worth your while, I tell you
that straight."
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, all unconsciously, the jockey had made
a mistake when he spoke of making money upon
the horse's victory, which was the last thing that
Mostyn, who never made a bet, cared about doing.
In some insidious fashion, this new suggestion
touched a cord in the boy's nature and made
him realise the peril in which he stood.  He,
who had never in his life done an act which
he could call dishonourable, what was he thinking
of now?  How could he have allowed himself,
even for a moment, to listen to so vile a
suggestion?  His cheeks flushed with shame.  With
a mighty effort he thrust the temptation aside.
He smote the table violently with his fist, and
broke out with an oath&mdash;an oath that came
strangely to his lips.
</p>

<p>
"D&mdash;&mdash; you, you dirty hound!"  He pushed
his chair bark, and stood trembling with wrath,
towering huge over the wretched little man.  "How
dare you come to me with such a proposal?
How dare you? how dare you?  Get out of the
room, and out of the house, and be sharp about
it, or before God&mdash;&mdash;"  He raised his fist
threateningly.
</p>

<p>
The little jockey slipped from his chair, nearly
sliding on to the floor in his dismay, and held up
his puny fists as if to ward off a blow.  "Look 'ere,
Mr. Clithero, sir," he whined, "what are you
a-gettin' at?  I came 'ere as a friend&mdash;for your
good."
</p>

<p>
"Go!" thundered Mostyn, pointing a trembling
forefinger at the door.  "I told you to go."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, I'm goin'."  The jockey, seeing that
he stood in no danger of bodily hurt, pulled himself
together and shuffled towards the door.  "You ain't
treated me fair, Mr. Clithero," he grumbled, as he
went.  His little eyes shot malice.  He muttered
something else under his breath&mdash;a remark that
was evidently not intended for Mostyn's ears; nor
did the latter, who had turned to ring the bell for
Frazer, notice the clenched fists or the vindictive
look.
</p>

<p>
At the door the jockey halted once more.  "Look
'ere," he growled, "you're not a-goin' to say anythin'
about this?  I trust you as a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"You may cheat your master, for all I care,"
said Mostyn, "as long as you don't do it for me.
That's his own look out, not mine, but remember
that I have nothing to do with you or with
your dirty tricks.  Now go!"  Once more he
pointed to the door, and the next moment,
mouthing an ugly word under his breath, the
jockey was gone.
</p>

<p>
As for Mostyn, he stood for a moment, breathing
hard, his teeth tightly clenched together; then he
threw himself down upon a chair, leaning his
elbows upon the table, and pressing his hands to
his forehead.
</p>

<p>
"My God!" he muttered to himself, "and
there was a moment when I might have yielded!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS GIVEN ANOTHER CHANCE.
</h3>

<p>
The following morning Pierce Trelawny appeared
at breakfast with a pale face and a look of
determination about his lips.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn, who was already seated at the table,
glanced up, mystified at his friend's unwonted
appearance.
</p>

<p>
"What's wrong, old chap?" he asked.  "You
look worried."
</p>

<p>
Pierce poured himself out a cup of coffee before
he responded, Mostyn watching him the while with
increasing anxiety.  "You haven't got bad news,
have you?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"It's about Cicely," Pierce explained at last.
There was a heavy frown upon his brow.  "Look
here, Mostyn, I can't stand this sort of thing any
longer&mdash;something has got to be done.  Cicely has
written to me.  Oh, it's the first letter she has
written."  He laughed hoarsely.  "We have kept
to our promise right enough up till now, but matters
have come to a crisis."
</p>

<p>
"Tell me," said Mostyn, drawing his chair nearer
to that of his friend with that display of sympathy
which was with him so charming a characteristic.
"But I can guess," he added with a melancholy
shake of the head.  "Cicely finds it impossible to
get on at home, even for the month or two that
remain."
</p>

<p>
"That's just it," said Pierce, tossing the letter
over to his friend.  "Read what she says for
yourself.  It makes one's blood boil, that any girl
can be treated in such a fashion, and I tell you
I've made up my mind to take matters into my
own hands."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn read the letter through carefully, the
frown deepening on his brow as he came to the
end.  Cicely had penned the epistle under the stress
of deep emotion, and the page was blotted here
and there where her tears had fallen upon it.  The
gist of her letter was that she could stay no longer
at home&mdash;that her father's insults and cruelty had
become unbearable&mdash;that he had even raised his
hand against her.  It was in her very misery of
spirit that she had at last yielded to the temptation
to write to Pierce, whom she loved so utterly, so
devotedly.  She had been seized by a terrible fear,
too, a fear which had haunted her for weeks and
months, that his love for her was on the wane;
she could bear it no longer, and so in her misery
she had broken her promise.  Would he come to
her?  The request was repeated over and over
again, in the course of the letter.  She wanted his
comfort&mdash;his support&mdash;his kiss&mdash;and if she were
denied these any longer, she feared her health
would break down.
</p>

<p>
"I'm going to her&mdash;I'm going to her to-day!"  Pierce
rose from the table, having swallowed his
coffee almost at a gulp, and eaten nothing.  He
pushed his chair back viciously and began parading
the room with long, angry strides.  "I'm not
going to be kept from Cicely another day,
and I don't care a hang what my father, or
anybody else, may do.  It was a shame&mdash;an
infernal shame&mdash;to keep us apart, and I've suffered
more than you can guess, Mostyn.  We love each
other, and what do you think it has been to me
to know that she has been left with that infernal
old&mdash;&mdash;  I beg your pardon, Mostyn," he added
hastily, "but I'm so upset I hardly know what
I'm saying."
</p>

<p>
"Why shouldn't Cicely come to me?" suggested
Mostyn, who was trying to keep his head cool.
"She could stay here at the Grange till after her
twenty-first birthday.  Wouldn't that satisfy your
father?"
</p>

<p>
Pierce wheeled round sharply and indignantly.
"And I not see her all the time," he exclaimed,
"just because of a silly fad of a silly old man!  And
how could you and I go about together, Mostyn, if
she were with you?  No, that won't do either.
I've made up my mind.  I'm going straight to
London; yes, to-day, in spite of the race, in spite
of everything, and I'm going to beard the lion in his
den.  I'm going to take Cicely out of his clutches&mdash;carry
her off by force if needs be.  She can stay
with my aunt, Lady Fenton, who knows her and
is fond of her, and who will do anything for me.
Cicely shall stay there till we can be married, and
that shall be just as soon as ever I can get the
licence."
</p>

<p>
"But the Squire&mdash;your father?" protested
Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
"He must do as he pleases," was the tempestuous
reply.  "I'm not going to worry myself about him.
He can cut me off if he likes, just as yours did you.
I've got a little money of my own, thank God! enough
to live on quietly somewhere in the suburbs."  He
made a wry face as he spoke.  "It'll be a bit
of a change, but I shall have to lump that, and I
daresay Cicely won't mind.  There, Mostyn, old
chap"&mdash;he came and stood by his friend's
side&mdash;"You must forgive me if I'm excited, but you
can see how it is and understand what I feel.  I'm
sorry that I shan't be with you at the races, but I
should be a shockingly poor companion for you if
I were.  I can't be of any service, either, there's that
at least to be said."
</p>

<p>
And so at last matters were settled, though it
was not without further parley.  Mostyn succeeded
in calming his friend after a while, and they sat
down together and talked the matter out seriously
and reasonably.  Their deliberations, however,
brought them to no new conclusion.  Pierce's mind
was made up, and he was quite prepared to defy
his father and to bear the consequences.
</p>

<p>
"You'll come for the wedding, Mostyn, won't
you?" he asked, when the sitting came to an end.
"It'll have to be an absolutely quiet affair.  Lady
Fenton and yourself will be the only two to be
present.  Cicely will be my wife long before Cipher
wins the Derby for you."
</p>

<p>
"I can quite believe that," commented Mostyn
drily, though he understood the sense in which
the remark had been intended.  "Anyway, Pierce,
I wish you luck, and I'm glad that you are going to
do something to make Cicely happy."
</p>

<p>
Thus it came about that, later that day,
Mostyn found himself without his friend in
the paddock of the Newmarket racecourse.  He
missed Pierce badly, for this was the first
time that they had not been together when one
of the races in which they were interested had
been decided.
</p>

<p>
There were, however, many faces that he knew.
Rada and Captain Armitage had been driven over
by Jack Treves.  The latter had been settled at
Partinborough for the last month or two, and had
done his best to monopolise Rada.  He had not
intruded his company upon Mostyn, though, of
course, it was inevitable that the two men should
meet now and then.  On these occasions Jack was
surly, his malice but thinly veiled.  Of Rada herself
Mostyn had lately seen but little.  A sense of
restraint had arisen between them, and half
instinctively they had avoided each other.  But
now she came to his side, and slipped a little
soft hand into his.  Just as soft as the hand
were the dark eyes he looked into, the smile that
played about her lips, and the tone in which she
addressed him.
</p>

<p>
"I do hope you'll win to-day, Mostyn," she
murmured.  "Asmodeus is a fine horse, and should
make a fight for it.  At any rate I wish you success,
I do indeed."
</p>

<p>
There was something in the girl's expression,
something beyond the softness and tenderness
which he had already noticed, that made Mostyn
scrutinise her face more carefully.  There were
black rims under her eyes, and he could have
sworn that she had been crying and that quite
recently.
</p>

<p>
He felt instinctively, too, that in this
gentleness of demeanour, so unusual to the wayward
girl, there was something of appeal, and of
appeal directed to himself.  It was as though
she wanted him to understand more than she
dared say.
</p>

<p>
He looked down pitifully into the girl's dark
eyes.  "Rada," he whispered, "you are not
happy.  I have been certain of it for a long time.
Will you tell me what has happened?  Oh"&mdash;he
hesitated&mdash;"is it because&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I wish I could speak to you," she sighed.
"I've wanted to ever so many times."  She hung
her head, evidently struggling with her pride.
"Oh, you don't know," she cried at last, clasping
her hands together, "what it has been like for
me!  There is no one that I can talk to&mdash;no one
who can sympathise with me."
</p>

<p>
"Why not have come to me?" asked Mostyn
reproachfully.  "Are we not good friends?"
</p>

<p>
"Good friends, yes!"  Her words were bitter.
"But that it must be you to whom I have to come
and admit that I have been a silly little fool&mdash;oh! the
silliest little donkey ever born!  Don't you
understand how it hurts me&mdash;how it lowers me in
my own eyes?"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind that," said Mostyn pitifully.
"You poor little thing, don't you think that after
all this time I have got to know you better, and
that I can make allowance for your whims
and all those wayward tricks of yours?  Tell
me the truth, Rada."  He trembled as he
spoke, for he felt that he had no right to put
the question since Rada could not be for him.
"You don't love Jack Treves; you don't want
to marry him?"
</p>

<p>
Rada shook her head, and then fixed her eyes
upon her race-card as though she were intensely
interested in it.  These two, who were talking of
matters of such vital interest to them both, stood
there in the midst of the pushing throng of the
paddock.  They spoke in lowered tones, and now
and again, when anyone passed close to them or
came to a halt by the railing where they stood,
Mostyn would make some remark in a louder
voice in order to make it appear that they were
merely discussing the races.
</p>

<p>
"He has been a brute to me," she murmured,
"a brute.  Just now, driving to the course, he
insulted me; he&mdash;he made me cry.  Love him?"  She
stamped her little foot.  "I hate him!"  This
time the words were genuine; they came
from her heart.
</p>

<p>
"And it was all because of that wretched
thousand pounds, and because of your pride.  Oh,
Rada!  Rada!  But it isn't too late," he went on.
"Thank God for that.  You are not bound to
the man."  Though he himself could never ask
her to be his wife, Mostyn reflected quickly, yet
she was not obliged to marry that scamp, that
bounder, Jack.
</p>

<p>
"I'm not sure that he wants to marry me."  She
sighed wearily.  "He's always comparing me
to Daisy Simpson&mdash;think of that!  He says she's
so much smarter than I.  But it's his father and
my father who insist that we shall be married.
Old Mr. Treves wants his son to marry a lady, you
see, and my father&mdash;well, you know it's a question
of money with him.  Far more has been borrowed
than we can ever repay."  She flushed as she made
the admission.
</p>

<p>
"I only know that you mustn't marry a man
you don't love!" cried Mostyn heatedly.  "Surely
the money can be found.  Castor will bring you
in enough if he wins the Derby.  Then there's
that thousand pounds you paid me: I've never
touched the wretched notes.  They're still lying at
the Grange in my safe&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!" interrupted Rada.  "I couldn't
accept any money from you; indeed I couldn't, not
a single penny.  I should never forgive myself,
and it would be worse than the other.  No," she
repeated despairingly, "there is no help for it."  She
paused, then broke into a laugh that grated
upon Mostyn's ears.  "What does it matter after
all?"  She was choking down a sob.  "There's no
one who cares what becomes of me; it doesn't matter
a scrap to anyone if I marry Jack or not&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn clenched his fists.  "You're wrong,
Rada," he said with all the energy he could
express.  "I care.  The fellow's not worthy of
you.  Besides, he's a bounder and a scamp&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Who's a bounder and a scamp?"  Mostyn
looked up quickly and Rada gave a little cry,
for Jack Treves, who had approached unseen
by either of them, was standing close by.  He
took Rada viciously by the arm; then turned
scowling upon Mostyn.  "Who's a scamp," he
repeated, "and what were you two talking
about?"
</p>

<p>
"It was nothing, Jack, nothing!" gasped Rada.
"Mr. Clithero and I&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I've had enough of Mr. Clithero and you,"
said Jack roughly.  "The sooner you both
understand that, the better.  I'm sick of
Clithero hanging about you and making mischief
between us.  I'd lay any odds that's what
he was doing when I came up."  He turned
again sharply upon Mostyn.  "Who is the
scamp you were talking about?" he asked again
aggressively.
</p>

<p>
"You!" replied Mostyn with fine nonchalance.
"I was talking about you.  I just said what
I thought."
</p>

<p>
Jack Treves took a step forward, his fists clenched.
His face was purple and congested.  But no blow
fell; he had had his experience, and did not wish
to repeat it.
</p>

<p>
Already the little scene had attracted some
attention, although it was only among the
immediate bystanders.  But these, if they expected
a fight, were doomed to disappointment.  Jack
stood scowling, then muttering "This isn't the
place for a scrap; but I'll be even with you,
for God I will!" he slipped his hand under
Rada's arm and unceremoniously bustled her
away.
</p>

<p>
The onlookers, robbed of their fun, growled
disapproval and dispersed likewise.  One of them,
however, whom Mostyn had not noticed before,
since he had kept himself well in the background,
remained.  Mostyn recognised the evil and
malicious face of the jockey, Ted Wilson.
</p>

<p>
The little man was dressed as Mostyn had seen
him the night before.  He wore the same tightly-fitting
covert coat with big shiny pearl buttons,
but he had replaced the cap by a bowler hat, pressed
down well on the back of his head.
</p>

<p>
"I wish 'e'd gone for yer!" Wilson muttered
between his teeth, drawing a few steps nearer.
"I wish 'e'd thrashed yer, Gawd 'elp me
I do!"
</p>

<p>
This was a fresh attack, and one which Mostyn
had not expected.  He supposed the jockey was
still incensed because his proposition had been
refused, and, not desiring any further discussion
on the subject, he turned away without deigning
a reply.  Wilson, however, followed at his
heels, yapping and snarling like a mongrel
cur.  "A low down trick you played me,"
he muttered.  "What did you want to do it
for?  The Lord knows I 'aven't done you no
'arm.  But to give a chap away and get 'im the
sack&mdash;why, you ought to be bloomin' well ashamed
of yerself!"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn turned at this.  "What on earth do
you mean?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Why," screeched the indignant little man,
"just listen to 'im!  As if 'e didn't know!  Wot
should I 'av got the sack for if you 'adn't split
to my boss?  Given me the chuck without a word
of explanation, 'e 'as, and not more'n a couple
of hours ago.  Why should 'e 'ave done it if you
'adn't rounded on me?  D&mdash;&mdash; 'im for a dirty Jew!
and d&mdash;&mdash; you too for&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
The jockey's language was charged with strange
oaths, and there was a lurid monotony about his
epithets.  However, he appeared to have a
grievance, and that being so, some explanation
seemed due to him.  The refinement of Mostyn's
speech sounded almost ridiculous when taken in
conjunction with that of the jockey.
</p>

<p>
"I assure you that you are absolutely mistaken
if you think that I have had anything to do with
your discharge, since I understand that you have
been discharged.  This is the first I have heard
of it, and I have not the smallest idea why
Mr. Isaacson should have acted so."
</p>

<p>
"You're a liar!" retorted Wilson.  "Is it
likely that Isaacson would have sacked me, an'
put up a chap like Jones, who may lose the race
for 'im, if 'e 'adn't thought that I might ride crook?
Do yer think I don't see through yer little game?"  His
narrow eyes sparkled with spite and malice
as he stared up into Mostyn's face.  "Got me the
chuck, yer did, so that Don Quixote might be
handicapped and yer own 'orse 'ave a better
charnce!  Oh, you're a sharp 'un, you are, but,
strike me pink!  I'll be even with yer for it,
Mr. Clithero, sir, if not to-day, then some other time.
Ted Wilson ain't the man not to get a bit of 'is
own back, you can bet your bottom dollar on
that.  My friend, Jack Treves"&mdash;he accented the
words&mdash;"'as got 'is knife into yer, too, I see, and
between the pair of us I'll lay you come off bad
in the end."
</p>

<p>
He had been speaking so volubly that Mostyn
had not been able to get a word in.  Now, once
more, and with all the patience he could muster,
he sought to convince the angry jockey that he
was quite innocent of the offence with which
he was charged.  But argument was futile,
as he quickly found out.  Wilson was
convinced that he had Mostyn to thank for what
had happened.
</p>

<p>
It was some time before Mostyn could throw off
his adversary, and it was only with renewed threats
of vengeance, and because he saw no less a person
than Mr. Isaacson himself approaching, in the
company of Sir Roderick Macphane, that Wilson
at last took himself off, and disappeared in the
direction of the nearest bar.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn reflected that he had another enemy to
contend with, and one who was even more likely
than Jack Treves to hit below the belt.  Luckily,
Asmodeus was quite safe in the charge of Stanhope,
and Mostyn could not conceive of any other way
by which he could be damaged; this since he was
not afraid of personal attack.  He did not worry
himself, therefore, when, later in the day, he saw
Wilson in the company of Jack, and realised that
the jockey had spoken the truth when he mentioned
Treves as his friend.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn looked up in response to a hearty slap
on the back, and found himself confronted by the
smiling face of Sir Roderick Macphane.  It was
a pleasure after the scowls with which he had been
met that day to look upon the genial face of the
old baronet.  Behind Sir Roderick stood a tall
man, of Jewish cast of features, whom Mostyn
recognised at once, though he had never met
the man, as David Isaacson, the owner of
Don Quixote.
</p>

<p>
"Mr. Isaacson wished to be introduced to you,
Mostyn," Sir Roderick said, "and so, as I caught
sight of you ten minutes ago, I brought him
up.  You are opponents to-day, of course, but
that's no reason why two sportsmen shouldn't
know each other.  I won't wish good luck to
the best man," he added heartily, "but to the
best horse, and as matters stand, it promises to
be a good race."
</p>

<p>
The Jew extended his hand to Mostyn and
smiled, showing a straight row of white teeth.
He was not ill-looking, and there was very little
to suggest the hardness with which he had been
accredited as a money-lender.  It was a little
surprising to find him on such good terms with
Sir Roderick, but then "Old Rory" was "hail
fellow well met" with all the world.
</p>

<p>
"It's even money on the horses," Isaacson
remarked; "I don't suppose one stands a better
chance than the other."  He turned to Mostyn,
scrutinising him rather closely.  His voice was
not unpleasant, though it possessed the Jewish
rasp.  "You know, of course," he continued, "that
I had to dismiss my jockey, Wilson, at a moment's
notice this morning, and that I've put up Jones
in his place.  Jones is a smart man, but, of course,
the handicap is a pretty severe one.  You see,
Mr. Clithero, I have reasons to believe that Wilson
wished to pull my horse so that yours might win.
I got my knowledge in rather a roundabout way.
It appears that someone has backed Asmodeus
pretty heavily, and when this person found that
Don Quixote was the favourite he approached
Wilson and offered to pay him to pull the horse.
I understand that Wilson had consented to do so;
so, as you may imagine, I fired him this morning,
and I shall probably place the whole matter before
the stewards.  It was the intermediary who acted
between the backer and Wilson who gave the story
away to one of my own men, and that's how it
came out.  It's bad luck on me," he added, "but
I shan't grudge you the race, Mr. Clithero, if luck
comes your way."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn saw how it was.  "The little skunk!"
he muttered to himself as he thought of Wilson.
"He was going to pull the horse whatever happened,
but thought he might make a bit more out of me
at the same time.  But he over-reached himself,
and has been given away by one of his pals.  And
he'll never believe that I didn't betray him; he'll
loathe me none the less if the truth comes out."
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick had a luncheon party that day,
holding, as usual, open house to all the friends
he might happen to meet.  Here, among smiling,
happy faces, Mostyn forgot some of his troubles
of the morning; moreover, he was keenly excited
about the race, for it seemed, indeed, that Asmodeus
stood an excellent chance of winning.  Don
Quixote had naturally gone down in the betting.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick was keenly interested, and discussed
the whole matter with the young man.
</p>

<p>
"By Jove!  Mostyn," he opined, "you've got
to win this time, or I don't know how you'll pocket
your cash.  Cipher's not going to win the Derby
for you, you know"&mdash;he shook his head
prophetically&mdash;"Cipher can't get away from Castor, to
say nothing of my Pollux."
</p>

<p>
To this Mostyn agreed.  He knew that it was
true.  Castor and Pollux were the two colts who
gave real promise for the coming Derby.  They
had never met, and yet they were both unbeaten,
each holding a record of some half-dozen victories
in the course of the year.
</p>

<p>
"Jove! what an extraordinary Derby it'll be,"
Mostyn commented, trying to distract his thoughts
from the excitement of the moment.  "Two horses,
Castor and Pollux, so exactly alike, as I understand
them to be, both having the same sire, both
boasting similar records, and not a line to go upon
to show which is the better!  It'll be a Derby
worth seeing, Sir Roderick."
</p>

<p>
The baronet agreed.  Nevertheless, as was only
to be expected, he favoured his own horse.  "Not
that I care so much about winning," he observed
with his broad, genial smile.  "One Derby should
be enough for any man.  Hipponous pulled that
off for me as well as the Leger.  I'm far keener
now," he added bluffly, "upon trying to drive
sense into the noddles of all those Socialists,
Radicals, Home Rulers, and agitators that grow
up like weeds about us.  A lot of disloyal fellows
who are so blind that they can't hear sense when
it's talked to them.  They simply don't know
upon which side their bread is feathered, and they
are only playing to butter their own nests!"
</p>

<p>
It was a muddled metaphor worthy of "Old
Rory" at his best.  Mostyn could not refrain from
laughing, as did Sir Roderick himself when he
realised what he had said.  He always roared over
his own tangled speeches, even in Parliament,
enjoying them quite as much as anyone else.
</p>

<p>
He had certainly been very much to the fore
at Westminster of late, and his wild attacks upon
the Government had added much to the enlivenment
of a dull session.  Yet "Old Rory" was
more popular than ever, and that with all parties
in the House.
</p>

<p>
Time passed pleasantly enough till the bell rang
and the course was cleared for the big race.
Mostyn remained in the paddock till Asmodeus,
a fine bay, long of limb and strong of barrel, strode
proudly out and was greeted by a cheer from the
crowd as he galloped easily past the Grand Stand.
</p>

<p>
The puce and black diamonds of Mostyn's colours
were quickly put in the shade by an aggressive
vision of gold as Asmodeus was followed by Don
Quixote, and now the crowd cheered again, though
in a minor key.  The horse had been heavily
backed, and there was no little discontent at the
fall in his price that morning; people were asking
each other the reason for the sudden change of
jockey.  Isaacson was unpopular, and there was
considerable prejudice against him, wholly without
reason; whereas Mostyn, who in barely a year
had become so prominent a figure upon racecourses,
stood high in popular favour.
</p>

<p>
"It's a match between you and me, Clithero,"
Isaacson said as the two men took up their places
to watch the race.  "They're off," he added a
moment later, levelling his glasses.  "A good start,
what?"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn remembered little of that race.  He stood,
indeed, his field-glasses raised, to all outward
appearance as calm and placid as Isaacson
himself.  He followed the horses as they ran, he
marked the failure of Bouncing Boy, he even
commented upon the riding of the jockey who
was up on Wisdom, a chestnut heavily backed for
a place, and who was palpably giving the horse
his head over much; but all the while he was
staring through a mist: it was as though a fog
had settled over the course, a fog which his eyes
could penetrate but which made everything appear
contorted, disproportionate, ridiculous.  Somehow
the thought came to him of that face which he had
seen peering through the window at the Grange;
every object he looked upon was disfigured in just
the same way.  There were men and women close
by at whom he could have laughed, so absurd did
they appear.  And all the while there was a great
thumping going on in his ears like the working
of a vast machine; it was so loud that he could
hardly hear the shouting of the crowd.
</p>

<p>
Asmodeus was leading; he knew that.  Asmodeus
had been leading for quite a long time.  Don
Quixote, with his glitter of gold, was several lengths
behind, and there were two or three horses in
between.  Which were they?  Mostyn tried to
distinguish them but failed.  What did it matter?
Asmodeus was leading.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the thumping that was the beating
of his heart stopped.  It was like the sudden
cessation of work in a factory or the stopping of
the engines on board a steamer.  Mostyn swayed
a little from side to side; he could imagine the
rolling of a vessel.  Asmodeus was no longer in
the front.  What did that matter?  Stanhope
was holding him in.  There was time enough yet
for a spurt.
</p>

<p>
There was a cold wind blowing that afternoon,
and the sky was grey.  A drizzling rain began to
fall.  Here and there umbrellas made their
appearance till angry protests from the crowd
compelled them to be lowered.  Mostyn noticed
all these minor events through the mist that
rendered everything so grotesque to his view.
</p>

<p>
The horses were near by now, very near.  They
had swung round the bend and were nearly level
with the Grand Stand.  Asmodeus had dropped
still further behind; there were several of his
opponents who had caught up and passed him.
The glitter of gold was to the fore.  Don Quixote
led.
</p>

<p>
How the crowd was roaring!  As a rule this was
music to Mostyn's ears, but to-day it was a fantastic
discord.  He could distinguish nothing, not a single
articulate word.  Why on earth did not Stanhope
spurt?  Surely, surely he was waiting too long?
</p>

<p>
Mostyn's brow was wet.  He did not know if
this was due to perspiration or to the rain; he could
not say if he felt hot or cold.  This was his last
chance&mdash;literally his last chance&mdash;and still that
spurt was delayed.
</p>

<p>
Ah!  Stanhope is giving Asmodeus his head
now!  "Come on, Asmodeus&mdash;brave horse!&mdash;for
the love of heaven, come!"  The chestnut is
passed; that is good: now another is held and
left behind; now another.  Asmodeus has forged
into the second place, but the winning-post is close
at hand, and Don Quixote of the maddening,
aggressive gold is still foremost.  Curse the gold!
</p>

<p>
It was a brave effort, but it failed, for Don
Quixote, too, was capable of a spurt.  All but
overhauled, the horse seemed to gather his whole
strength into that supreme moment.  Once more
he shot ahead&mdash;yellow, huge and grotesque to
Mostyn's eyes&mdash;and passed the winning-post just
a palpable length ahead.
</p>

<p>
It was over: Mostyn had played and lost!
</p>

<p>
He descended from the chair upon which he
had been standing, quite forgetting that Isaacson
was by his side, and strolled away.  The rain beat
in his face, his cheeks were dripping with moisture,
but it did not occur to him to put up his umbrella.
Now and then he collided with someone in the
crowd and muttered an apology without looking
round.
</p>

<p>
A heavy hand was laid upon his shoulder.  He
recognised the voice of Sir Roderick.

<p>
"Mostyn, my boy, this is a knock.  I didn't
expect it.  With Jones up on Don Quixote I thought
Asmodeus would win.  But look here; you mustn't
give in.  I've got a plan for you: it isn't a cert,
but it'll give you a sporting chance.  Now,
understand, I'll take no denial.  Pollux shall run for
you in the Derby&mdash;and Pollux is as good a horse
as Castor.  Come along and we'll talk it over."
</p>

<p>
He led Mostyn away.  The latter was still too
dazed to understand clearly what had been said
to him.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN MEETS WITH AN ACCIDENT.
</h3>

<p>
It was early afternoon of the first day of the Epsom
Summer Meeting.  Mostyn had just finished lunch,
of which he had partaken in the solitude of his
Jermyn Street chambers.  He had not been tempted
down to Epsom that day, for he had had a hard
week's work, and he wished to keep all his strength
in reserve for the morrow, the great Derby Day
that was to decide his fate.
</p>

<p>
Pollux, of course, was at Epsom, in the charge of
Joseph Dean, the trainer who had had the care
of him from the first.  Pollux was to be ridden by
Fred Martin, now completely recovered, who, upon
this occasion, would sport the puce and black of
Mostyn's colours instead of the scarlet and silver
of Sir Roderick's.
</p>

<p>
Never, perhaps, in the history of the great race
had so much popular interest been aroused.  There
was no first favourite, but, instead, there were
two horses who would both go to the post with
unbroken records, and between which, upon form,
there was not a line to choose.  As a result, the
two horses naturally stood even in the betting;
it was two to one against either of them, and there
was a considerable drop between this and the
betting upon the next horse, Pendragon, who was
third in popular estimation.
</p>

<p>
Then, not only did Castor and Pollux stand
level in the betting, but the similarity of the two
animals, even their names, which betokened kinship,
could not fail to arouse interest.  Those who had
seen them together at Epsom&mdash;now that they had
actually met for the first time&mdash;reported them as
being so exactly alike that they could hardly be
recognised apart.  They were both tall, black
horses, and there was nothing to choose between
them as regarded height or breadth or muscle.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, just as much as the horses, the owners
excited attention.  Castor was the property of a
girl, and one so young as to seem totally out of
place in the racing world.  Pollux, which everyone
knew to have belonged to popular and genial "Old
Rory," had been suddenly transferred, little more
than three weeks ago, to Mostyn Clithero, that
meteoric young man whose prowess upon the
race-course was so remarkable, and who had been buying
horses wildly and madly all over the country, and
who seemed bent, for no explicable reason, upon
making a name for himself upon the Turf.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn sat musing over the events of the past
few weeks, as well as on those which were still
concealed by the obscurity of the future.  Whatever
the result might be, at least this could be
said&mdash;he had had his sporting chance, and he had
taken it like a sportsman.  If he failed, it was
through the chance of war, not through any fault
of his.  The morrow might see him a vastly wealthy
man or a pauper.  Had it not been for Sir Roderick,
there would have been no doubt as to the issue
weeks ago, for Mostyn had indeed lost his last
chance when Asmodeus failed for the Guineas.
It had taken all the kind-hearted baronet's
eloquence, as it was, to induce Mostyn to accept
Pollux, and in the end the young man would only
yield by striking a particularly hard bargain for
himself in the event of the colt winning.  "Old
Rory" had been forced to take up a selfish line.
"Heavenly powers, lad!" he had cried at last,
testily, "aren't your millions worth more than
the blessed Derby stakes?"  And Mostyn had
been constrained to see it in this light.
</p>

<p>
The worst of it was that he was thrown into such
direct antagonism to Rada.  The race lay between
him and her&mdash;there was no doubt about that.
</p>

<p>
He would have liked to tell her the whole truth,
so that she should not misunderstand his motives,
as she was bound to do.  But it was impossible for
him to speak now&mdash;for the girl's own sake he saw
that it was impossible.  To win the Derby with
Castor was her dream, her ambition, the one thing
she asked of life.  Why should he make her unhappy,
as she was bound to be if she knew how great a loss
he would suffer from her success?  She could not
help him in any way&mdash;she could not scratch Castor
even if she wished to do so&mdash;there was far too much
money already involved upon the colt.
</p>

<p>
Of course, she had misunderstood, "So you
have bought Pollux!" she had cried.  "It makes
no difference to my chances, of course, but I didn't
think that you"&mdash;there was a world of reproach in
her tone&mdash;"would have fought me to the end.
I shall hate you if Pollux wins&mdash;I shall really hate
you."  There was something of the old defiance
in her tone.
</p>

<p>
"Rada," he had said, striving hard to give her
a hint, "remember our wager.  It was your life or
my life.  If Pollux wins&mdash;&mdash;"  If Pollux won, he
could claim his reward, he could ask Rada to marry
him; if Pollux failed, she was lost to him for
ever&mdash;he would be a beggar.
</p>

<p>
But Rada interrupted him.  She would not
understand.  She bit her lip and stamped her
foot.  "So you are still thinking of that foolish
challenge?" she cried.  "You are still fighting to
win a Derby before me?  I think you are mean,
mean and cowardly.  I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"  She had broken
off and run away from him, but he was certain that
there were tears in her eyes, and he had hated
himself for the pain he gave her.  But there was
nothing to be done.  He must wait, bear her disdain,
till after the Derby, and then if Pollux won he could
explain.  If Pollux lost, why, then, everything must
go.  It didn't matter.
</p>

<p>
He left for London the next day, and did not see
Rada again.  But he was bound to meet her at
Epsom&mdash;he thought of the meeting with mingled
feelings.
</p>

<p>
It was as he mused thus, that visitors, who turned
out to be Pierce and Cicely, were announced.  They
had been married now for some three weeks, and
they had but just returned to London from a visit
which they had been paying to Pierce's father in
Worcestershire.  They had gone down in fear and
trepidation as to the manner in which they would
be received by the bluff and rather choleric old
squire.
</p>

<p>
The latter had made no sign when the news
reached him of his son's intention to disobey the
strict injunctions laid upon him.  The marriage had
taken place just as Pierce had schemed it out,
and the two young people had gone to Paris for a
brief honeymoon.  While there, Pierce had received
a summons, worded with characteristic brevity, to
return to England with his wife, and to present
himself at the parental domain.  So much Mostyn
knew; of the result of their visit he had not yet
heard a word.
</p>

<p>
Evidently nothing very tragic had occurred, for
Pierce and Cicely entered laughing, and palpably
in the best of spirits.  Mostyn kissed his sister
affectionately; she looked charming as a young
bride, and there was colour in her cheeks such
as he had not seen there for many a long day.
Pierce, too, scrupulously dressed as ever, seemed
particularly well satisfied with himself and with
the world at large.
</p>

<p>
"Well, how is it?" asked Mostyn.  "Have you
been forgiven and taken back to the fold?"
</p>

<p>
Pierce sank down into a chair, his sides shaking
with laughter.  "You will hardly believe it,
Mostyn," he said as soon as he could find his breath,
"but the sly old boy was having a joke with me
all the time!  He wanted me to run off with Cicely
against his express will.  He wanted to see if I
would have the pluck to do it!  Think of
that&mdash;there's a facetious old sportsman for you!  You
remember how he threatened me, how he gave
me to understand that all sorts of penalties would
fall upon my unhappy head if I disobeyed him;
of course, I imagined that I should be cut off with
the proverbial shilling, and all the rest of it, and
the old chap knew that I would think so.  All the
time he was laughing in his sleeve and simply
pining to be disobeyed&mdash;just wanted to prove my
mettle&mdash;that's what he said himself, roaring with
laughter, and as pleased as Punch about it all.
Oh, what an idiot I was to have waited all those
months without so much as seeing Cicely, and I
verily believe that if I had conscientiously allowed
the year to pass the old governor would have
disinherited me for that!"
</p>

<p>
Cicely, too, joined in the laughter that Pierce's
story gave rise to; she was looking very happy,
a little bashful, but her eyes were soft and gentle,
and Mostyn went over and kissed her again,
congratulating her now from the bottom of his heart,
as well as Pierce, for the happy issue out of their
troubles.  All was well with them, at least, and,
doubtful as he was as to his own position, he would
not grudge them a fraction of their happiness.
</p>

<p>
After a little while, however, a slight cloud crossed
Cicely's face.  "We've so much to say about
ourselves," she remarked penitently, "that we are
quite forgetting about you, Mostyn, and about
another matter&mdash;a very serious matter, too, which
is troubling us, and which will trouble you when
you hear of it."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind me," said Mostyn, "I'm all right.
I stand as good a chance to win to-morrow as to
lose, and what more than that can any man expect?
We'll discuss my affairs later on.  Tell me the
trouble."
</p>

<p>
"It's about father," said Cicely gravely.  "But
perhaps you've heard, Mostyn?"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn shook his head.  He had heard no news
as to his father for several months.  His time had
been so wholly taken up that he had been unable to
give his attention to anything except the matter in
hand.  "Is anything wrong?" he asked a little
anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"Very, very wrong, I'm afraid," replied the girl,
shaking her head ominously.  "I shouldn't have
heard anything about it any more than you have,
only it came to my ears in a roundabout way when
we were in Worcestershire.  There was a man
staying with the Pentons, who are neighbours of
the Trelawnys, you know, and he knew James and
Charles very well&mdash;I think he had some sort of
connection with the bank; he told me all about the
misfortunes which have suddenly befallen our
father."
</p>

<p>
"Misfortunes?" queried Mostyn, puzzled.  "I
hadn't an idea that there was anything wrong.
I should have thought that father was the very
last man on earth to have got into any sort of
trouble, and the bank&mdash;why, the bank must be
as stable as any in London."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! it's not the bank, and it's nothing for which
father is to blame," Cicely went on hurriedly.
"It's James and Charles who've turned out wrong.
Oh, isn't it sad?" she went on, "for you know how
absolutely he believed in them; you and I were
the black sheep, Mostyn, but they were everything
that they should be."
</p>

<p>
"That's why they've gone wrong," put in Pierce,
with a grunt of disapprobation.  "A couple of
beastly prigs.  I always hated them, though they
are your brothers, Sis.  Well, there's one
consolation, which is that your father must have found
out his mistake by now, and recognised that he
blundered when he turned you and Mostyn out
of doors.  It ought to have been the other two."
</p>

<p>
"What have they done?" asked Mostyn.
</p>

<p>
"Charles has run away with a ballet girl or some
terribly impossible person," Cicely explained.  "He
induced father to make over a large sum of money
to him, professing that he wanted it for that
charitable work he pretended to be so interested in.
I don't believe there was ever anything of the
sort," she added indignantly; "it was only an excuse
of Charles's to get a little more liberty while he was
living at home."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn said nothing, but smiled to himself.
He knew that Cicely was right.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as he had got his money," the girl
went on, "he showed himself in his true colours.
He laughed at father, and called him a pious old
fraud, or something of the sort, which was wicked
and cruel of him, for whatever he may be, our
father is at least no hypocrite.  Then Charles
threw up his position at the bank, announced that
he was going to marry the impossible person, and
disappeared from home."
</p>

<p>
"So much for Charles," said Mostyn.  He had
very little sympathy with Charles.  "What about
James?"
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that's worse still, very much worse,"
Cicely continued, a little quiver at the sides of her
lips proving that she was really moved.  "James
has been getting into money troubles, though how
he can have managed it, I haven't the remotest
idea.  For, of course, he didn't gamble or bet or
anything of that sort."
</p>

<p>
"Stock Exchange," interjected Pierce, his upper
lip curving.  "It's a deadly sin to back a race-horse,
but you may stand to lose or win your thousands
upon the rise or fall of stock.  That's one of
those things which your father may be able to
explain, but which knocks the ordinary man silly."
</p>

<p>
"I suppose it was on the Stock Exchange,"
Cicely went on.  "Anyhow, he lost a great deal
of money, and at last it is supposed that he must
have contrived to tamper with the books at the
bank.  Of course, he meant to put everything
right, but, as usual, when the time came, he could
not do so, and so he forged father's name to a bill,
or whatever you call those dreadful things, for a
large sum of money, and the worst of it is, that
that bill has got into the hands of a man who knows
the signature to be a forgery.  You can see what
terrible trouble there is, and father&mdash;I saw him
yesterday&mdash;is nearly off his head with anxiety.
He's all alone in that great house in Bryanston
Square, for James, mean coward that he is, has
absconded to America, and Charles hasn't been
anywhere near the house."
</p>

<p>
"Is the sum so large," asked Mostyn, "that
father is unable to settle with this man?  I suppose,
after all, it's only a question of money, and that
if the bill is met, nothing will be said about the
forged signature.  If that's the case&mdash;-well, if Pollux
wins to-morrow&mdash;there won't be much difficulty in
pulling father out of this hole."
</p>

<p>
Cicely shook her head.  "No, it isn't only a
matter of money," she explained.  "That's just
the horrible part of it.  It was because we thought
that money might settle it that Pierce and I went
to Bryanston Square last night.  Then we learnt
that the man who holds the bill is a bitter enemy
of father's, and he vows that he'll show the whole
thing up; it's no good offering to pay him, to meet
the bill at maturity, or anything of that sort; he is
a very rich man, and doesn't care what he loses.
His one wish is to make things uncomfortable for
the Clithero family, and he'll do it, too, for he's
hard and cruel&mdash;a Jew."
</p>

<p>
"Who is this man?" asked Mostyn.  "Do I
know him?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes."  It was Pierce who volunteered the
information.  "It's Isaacson, the fellow who owns
Don Quixote."
</p>

<p>
"Isaacson!"  Mostyn wrinkled his brows.
"Isaacson is a hard nut to crack, and, as you say,
money doesn't mean much to him.  He's on the
way to becoming a millionaire as it is, and if he's
got a private spite&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"It's both a private and a business spite, I
believe," Cicely declared.  "I heard father speak
of him, I remember, about a year ago, and of a
row there had been between them in the City.  And
then, after that, they met at some dinner-party
or other, and there was a scene.  Father expressed
his opinion in his usual forcible way, and I expect
Mr. Isaacson did so, too.  Anyway, they have
never forgiven each other, and this is the result.
Isaacson will show James up for what he is, and
the whole family will be discredited."
</p>

<p>
"According to father, we have already disgraced
the family," remarked Mostyn with some bitterness.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!"  Cicely lifted her fair head, and a tear
glistened in her eye.  "He is a changed man now,
Mostyn.  You would be sorry for him if you saw
him, indeed you would.  I believe he realises the
mistakes he made.  He asked me after you, and
his voice shook as he spoke&mdash;he is just a poor,
broken-down old man, and I think his health is
giving way.  The wheels of time have ground our
revenge for us, Mostyn."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn sat for a moment, thinking deeply.  "You
are right, Cicely," he said.  "He is our father, and
he acted justly according to his lights.  It's not
for us to bear malice.  I'll tell you what I'll
do&mdash;&mdash;"  He started up from his chair.  "I'll go and see
Isaacson at once.  He lives in Portman Square,
I believe, and if he's not at Epsom it's very likely
that I shall find him.  I'm bound to see him at
the Derby to-morrow if I miss him to-day, but one
can't talk 'shop' down there.  Of course, I don't
know that I can do anything, but I'll have a try."
</p>

<p>
"And go to father afterwards, will you,
Mostyn?"  Cicely rested her hand upon her brother's arm.
"He will see you, I'm sure of it.  His eyes were
quite wistful when he spoke of you, though he
did not ask me to bring about a meeting.  And he
will be grateful when he knows that you have tried
to help him.  He's never needed to turn to anyone
for help and comfort before, and it's that, I think,
more than anything else, that has broken him."
</p>

<p>
And so it was decided, and, after making their
arrangements for the following day, Pierce and
Cicely took their departure.  Cicely was to spend
the whole day with her father, while Pierce was
to meet Mostyn in Eaton Square, whence, as the
year before, they were to go down to Epsom on
Sir Roderick's coach.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn drove without any delay to David
Isaacson's house, and he was lucky enough to find
the financier at home.  As he had expected, he
found the house a particularly luxurious one.  The
door was swung open by two liveried and powdered
flunkeys, while a grave butler appeared to enquire
his business.  The hall was lavishly decorated in
marble, and the room into which Mostyn was
shown, although not on a large scale, was suggestive,
even to the very smallest item, of ostentatious
wealth.  Yet it was not so many years, as Mostyn
knew, since David Isaacson had occupied humble
little offices somewhere off Regent Street, living
and sleeping in a couple of dingy rooms just over
them.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!  Mr. Clithero, I'm glad to see you."  Isaacson,
attired in a resplendent afternoon lounge
suit, entered the room, a large cigar held in the
corner of his mouth.  He appeared a strange figure
in the midst of the almost feminine luxury of his
apartment, and yet there was something about the
man which rather appealed to Mostyn.  There was
a good-humoured twinkle in his dark eyes, and a
certain sincerity about his lips which rather belied
his reputation for hardness.  A sharp man of
business, one who would insist upon his pound of
flesh, but honest withal&mdash;so Mostyn summed him up.
"Nice little place I've got here, eh?"  The
Jew gazed complacently round the ornate apartment,
fully conscious of the immense value of the
draperies, of the pictures, and of the various objects
of art.  There was hardly anything that was not
a <i>chef d'oeuvre</i> in its way.  "I am glad you have
come to see me.  But why not at Epsom?  I should
have thought that you would have been down for
the first day's racing."  He offered Mostyn a cigar,
and then proceeded to discuss the prospects for
the morrow's Derby.
</p>

<p>
"Fancy!" he said, as Mostyn, in obedience to
his invitation, seated himself and lit the cigar
which he had accepted.  "When I heard there
was a Clithero to see me, I fancied it was someone
else altogether.  It was lucky you gave my man
your Christian name as well as your surname, for
I shouldn't have been at home to any other Clithero.
By the way, it never struck me before, and I hope
you won't be insulted by the question&mdash;you're no
relation to that blatant, conceited, self-righteous
prig, old John Clithero, the banker, are you?  But
of course, it's not likely, a sportsman like you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I am John Clithero's son," Mostyn said quietly.
</p>

<p>
"God of my fathers!"  Isaacson muttered another
exclamation under his breath, which Mostyn
failed to understand, but which he took to be a
Hebrew oath.  "You the son of John Clithero?
Well, I'd never have believed it&mdash;never!  I'm
sorry&mdash;I'm downright sorry, if I've offended you,
but really, upon my word, you know, I never
associated you with that lot.  Now I come to think
of it, though, I believe I did see something in the
paper&mdash;but I forgot all about it, and I didn't know
you then.  There's no friendship between your
father and me, Mr. Clithero," he went on, "but
you&mdash;well, that's a different matter.  I admire your
pluck; a true sportsman always appeals to me."  He
had begun his apology awkwardly, but he ended
it with candour, stretching out his hand, which
Mostyn took readily enough.
</p>

<p>
"To think that you're a son of John Clithero!"
the Jew repeated.  "Well, that beats everything."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn took advantage of the opening thus
offered him, to explain the object of his visit.  He
had nothing to say in defence of his brother, nor,
very wisely perhaps, did he attempt to say much
for his father, for it was palpable that Isaacson
felt very strongly upon the subject of his supposed
wrongs at the hands of John Clithero.  He stated
his case in simple words, and pleaded as though it
were a personal favour that he was asking.
</p>

<p>
Isaacson did not allow Mostyn to conclude.  He
sat listening for a few minutes, chewing at his big
cigar; then he started to his feet, crossed the room
quickly, and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
For a moment Mostyn fancied this to be an
indication that the interview was terminated, that
Isaacson would hear no more, but he was quickly
undeceived by the smile upon the man's face and
by his genial tone.
</p>

<p>
"Say no more about it, my boy," Isaacson cried
heartily.  "I've rung the bell for my secretary,
and I'll ask him to look out the bill and hand it
over to you.  It's a different thing altogether now
that I know you're concerned in the business.  We
are both of us sportsmen, what? and one sportsman
isn't going to round on a friend or play a shabby
trick.  Old John's been taken down a peg or two
as it is, I expect, and he'll feel it all the more when
he knows that it's you who've pulled him out of
the mire.  You shall have the bill here and now."
</p>

<p>
"But&mdash;&mdash;" faltered Mostyn, taken aback by
Isaacson's generosity, "I'm not prepared to take
up the bill immediately.  It's for a large sum,
and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never mind taking up the bill!  I'll trust
you for that," responded the other.  "Get the
thing in your hands while you can, that's the best
plan.  This brother of yours has bolted to America,
I understand.  Well, let him stick there, for he's
a good riddance to the country, and as to old John,
I hope he'll learn his lesson, and show a little more
charity in his dealings with the world."
</p>

<p>
As Isaacson spoke, the secretary entered the
room in response to the bell, was given his
instructions, and retired.
</p>

<p>
Isaacson seated himself once more by Mostyn's
side, leaning forward and tapping him familiarly
upon the knee.  "Folks say I'm a hard man,"
he went on, "and perhaps I shouldn't be here if
I hadn't refused to listen sometimes to the appeals
that are made to me; but when it comes from you,
Clithero, there's no thinking twice.  You're straight
as they make them, and I should be very sore if
I felt I'd hurt you.  I happen to know," he went
on, lowering his voice, "that that infernal little
jockey of mine, that rascal Wilson, tried to make
a bit off you by promising to pull Don Quixote.
That came to my ears through the same individual
who gave Wilson away&mdash;also that you refused, and
kicked the little scoundrel out.  Well, though I
never thought you would have been a party to
such a trick, I liked you all the better for it, for,
after all, you'd have run no danger, and you must
be jolly keen on winning a big race, judging by
the number of horses you've run in the course of
a year.  There, my boy, now you know all about
it, and why it's a pleasure to me to hand you over
the bill."
</p>

<p>
It was news to Mostyn to learn that Isaacson
knew all about Wilson's proposal to him, and he
flushed a little to think that, even for a moment,
the Jew might have thought it possible for him to
yield; but at the same time he remembered how
he had been tempted, and the thought of this
heightened the colour in his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Wilson, he knew, had lost his licence as a
consequence of Isaacson's complaint against him.
The case had been clearly proved, and evidently
there had been no necessity to bring Mostyn's
name into the matter.  Of Wilson himself, he had
seen nothing more since the day of the Two
Thousand Guineas, nor, indeed, had he had word with
Jack Treves.  The latter had studiously avoided
him, even when the two men had met, as they were
bound to meet, upon the day of the One Thousand
Guineas, when Mostyn's filly had proved, as he
expected, quite unequal to the task of even running
into a place.  If Wilson and Treves still thought of
avenging themselves against Mostyn, they had, so
far, made no move.
</p>

<p>
A quarter of an hour later, refusing the hearty
invitation to return and dine, the incriminating
document safely in his possession, Mostyn took his
departure.  He was anxious to proceed straight to
his father's house, and to set the mind of John
Clithero at rest.  It would be strange to meet his
father again, and he wondered how he would be
received.
</p>

<p>
He stood on the doorstep while one of the
gorgeously liveried men servants whistled sharply for
a hansom.  The house stood at the corner of the
square, and presently Mostyn could hear the sound
of rapidly approaching wheels, though he could
not see the vehicle itself.  It sounded to him,
however, as if two hansoms were racing each other
in answer to the summons.
</p>

<p>
At that moment a little child, a fair-haired baby
girl, escaped from her nursemaid, whose attention
had been distracted by the extravagant golden
livery of the footman, and toddled into the road
just as the two hansoms swept round the corner.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn saw the danger.  With a shout he sprang
forward and seized the little girl almost from under
the horses' hoofs.  He regained the curb, escaping
almost by a miracle, but so quick had been his
movements that, once out of danger, he slipped
and fell, rolling over, his arm bent at an awkward
angle beneath him.
</p>

<p>
The nursemaid, wailing with fear, gathered
the little child into her arms, but Mostyn lay where
he had fallen till the two footmen and a policeman
came to his assistance.
</p>

<p>
He was not unconscious, and presently he moved
and sat up.  But his arm hung limply at his side
and he realised a ghastly pain close to the shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Yet he tried to smile reassuringly into the faces
of those who were bending over him.  "It's all
right," he murmured.  "I'm quite safe, but&mdash;but
I think I've broken my arm."
</p>

<p>
With which he promptly fainted away.  They
carried him back carefully into the house of David
Isaacson.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN IS BETTER UNDERSTOOD.
</h3>

<p>
The company had assembled, as the year before,
at Sir Roderick Macphane's house in Eaton Square
for the drive to the Derby.  There were some new
faces, but for the greater part the party was the
same as that which had been present on the
occasion of "Old Rory's" victory.  Lord Caldershot
had arrived early, just the same immaculately
dressed Lord Caldershot, with eye-glass in eye
and inordinately tall collar, uncomfortably tight
round his neck.  He was enquiring diligently if
Miss Rada Armitage was to be present that day,
ready to declare himself as before, her cavalier,
all the more proud of being so because "the little
minx is going to win the Derby, by Jove!  Fancy
a girl of her age owning a Derby winner!"
</p>

<p>
Rada was expected, and duly arrived, but
Captain Armitage, who accompanied her, walked
with the assistance of a stick, and had completely
lost all his irresponsible gaiety of demeanour.  He
appeared morose and sullen, the result of a week
or so of enforced abstinence from strong drink.
He had, indeed, been very ill, and it was against
the orders of the doctor that he had ventured out
that day.  But it was the Derby&mdash;Castor's Derby,
Rada's Derby&mdash;and the temptation was too great
for him.
</p>

<p>
"Where is Mr. Clithero, my hated rival?"
smiled Rada, as Pierce Trelawny approached and
shook hands with her, freeing her for the moment
from the attentions of the assiduous Caldershot.
</p>

<p>
"Didn't you know?"  Pierce shook his head
sympathetically.  "Poor Mostyn had a bad
accident yesterday and broke his arm.  He saved
a little girl from being run over, with happy results
as far as the child was concerned, but just the
reverse for himself."
</p>

<p>
Rada paled as she listened.  "He is not in
danger?" she asked eagerly; then, reassured by
Pierce's smile, she drew her breath in sharply.
"Of course you wouldn't be here if he was.  But
how brave of him: he saved the child's life?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he saved the child's life," repeated Pierce.
"He fell from his own momentum when he had
got back upon the kerb.  It was just outside
David Isaacson's house, and they carried him
inside and made him as comfortable as they could.
He's there now; he'll be well in a week or so, but,
of course, it was all up with the Derby.  Poor
chap, he won't see one of the finest races that we
have been promised for years.  His own horse, too,
pitted against yours, Miss Armitage."
</p>

<p>
The girl said little, but the colour returned only
slowly to her cheeks.  A sense of faintness had
come upon her when she had learnt of Mostyn's
accident, and this had revealed to her, more
forcibly than ever, how much she really cared.
</p>

<p>
She did care.  What was the use of attempting
to deceive herself?  That day when Mostyn's
lips had met hers she had learnt that she loved&mdash;yes,
though she had torn herself away crying aloud
that she hated him.  Then he had gone away,
and she had eagerly desired him to return.  She
had written to him, and, like a foolish man, he had
taken her letter far more literally than she had
intended it.  She had expressed her desire to be
friends, and had hinted her approval of Jack
Treves because he had promised not to "bother"
her with love-making that year.  She would have
broken with Jack, ready to defy him and her father,
if Mostyn had spoken again, if he had shown any
desire to be more than just the friend he now
professed to be.  She had given him plenty of
hints&mdash;or thought she had&mdash;but Mostyn had been
too blind to see them.  So poor Rada had concluded
that he did not care any more; that, if he had ever
cared, the love he bore her had been killed, perhaps
by her own folly.
</p>

<p>
There was a time when she had seen her way
to paying off her debts, and her father's debts,
to Jack Treves.  Castor had done so well, and
promised to do better in the future.  But in the
meanwhile fresh debts were incurred, so that,
indeed, when she had opened her heart to Mostyn
in the paddock at Newmarket, it was true that
she was more closely bound to Jack than before.
And yet she could not help thinking that the latter
had grown tired of her&mdash;no wonder, perhaps, since
she treated him with scant ceremony&mdash;and, as
for herself, how sick and tired she had grown of
a bond that galled and vexed her!  She had come
to hate Jack Treves: yet what did it matter what
became of her since Mostyn had ceased to care?
</p>

<p>
"It's hard luck, isn't it," Pierce was saying,
"but, after all, Mostyn is in good hands and will
be quite all right.  I'd have stayed behind with
him, but he insisted that I must go to look after
you.  My wife is with Mostyn"&mdash;he lowered his
voice&mdash;"and his father is with him, too," he
continued.  "You know that they have been on
bad terms for the last year, and they have just
been reconciled.  Mostyn did something for his
father, something that I can't tell you about, and
which has saved old Mr. Clithero from a very
awkward position.  And now"&mdash;Pierce smiled&mdash;"the
old man is at his son's bedside, in the house
of a man whom he professed to loath and despise;
and I verily believe that he, to whom racing has
always been the devil's work, is as anxious as
Mostyn himself for Pollux to pull off the Derby."
</p>

<p>
"Pollux won't," said Rada, with something of
her old spirit.  Whatever she might be feeling, her
pride was in arms against anyone, and especially
Pierce, guessing her secret.  "I think it is mean
of Mostyn to wish to beat me," she continued,
her cheeks flushing now.  "If he was so keen on
carrying out his word he might have tried for the
Derby next June.  He gave himself five years.
Besides, the whole thing was so silly; no one has
taken it seriously but he."
</p>

<p>
Pierce noted the girl's flushed cheeks and he
read the truth of her love in her eyes.  He
understood what she must feel, and how heartless
Mostyn's conduct must seem to her, since she
knew nothing of the will and of the incalculable
importance it was for him that Pollux should win
the race.  Was it not for her sake, too, that
Mostyn was depending upon Pollux?  But she did
not know&mdash;she could not know.
</p>

<p>
How he longed to explain!  Could he not give
her a hint?  But he quickly found himself involved
in totally unexpected difficulties.
</p>

<p>
"Don't be hard upon Mostyn, Miss Armitage,"
he ventured.  "Really, I assure you, he hasn't
done this out of ill-will to you.  If only I could
get you to feel that!  Nor is it that silly wager
which makes him so keen upon winning the Derby.
It may look to you like spite, but believe me&mdash;try
to believe me&mdash;it's quite the reverse."  Poor
Pierce stammered painfully.  He wanted to do
the right thing both by his friend and by Rada.
He could see that the latter had been deeply
wounded in her affection, and he felt that if by
chance Pollux should win the race she might be
too deeply offended with Mostyn to listen to any
explanation.  And yet it was for her as much as
for his millions that Mostyn was fighting.
</p>

<p>
"I don't understand you, Mr. Trelawny," said
Rada.  "Please try to explain yourself."  She
tapped the floor impatiently with the toe of her
little shoe.  Her dark eyes were fixed upon Pierce,
who felt particularly uncomfortable.
</p>

<p>
"Mostyn cares for you far too much&mdash;&mdash;," he
began hesitatingly.
</p>

<p>
"Cares for me!"  Despite her determination
not to betray herself Rada could not help
interrupting.  "When he wants to be the one to rob
me of my victory!  If Pollux wins he will laugh
at and mock me, because I laughed at and mocked
him once: he will say that I challenged him to
win a Derby before me, challenged him unfairly
because I already had a horse in training.  He
wants to humiliate me&mdash;that's what he is playing
for&mdash;and you say he cares!"  Rada poured out
her words tempestuously, though they were spoken
in an undertone lest they should be overheard.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, how can I explain?" Poor Pierce was
conscious by now of the slough into which he had
blundered.  He was quite unable to extricate
himself, and only made matters worse by his
attempts.  "Mostyn loves you, Miss Armitage,"
he faltered.  "It's for your sake that he wants
Pollux to win; for your sake and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"For my sake!"  Rada broke into a harsh
laugh.  "When he knows what this Derby means
to me, that it is the ambition of my life!  For
my sake!"
</p>

<p>
"But it is!"  Pierce had gone too far to withdraw.
"I tell you Mostyn loves you.  But unless
Pollux wins"&mdash;he faltered and hesitated.  Mostyn
had bidden him keep the secret, from Rada most
especially.  For what would happen if she knew?
The girl would be robbed of all her happiness in
victory, should victory be hers.  How could she
rejoice knowing that her triumph meant the ruin
of another?
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she prompted, "unless Pollux wins?"  She
had suddenly imagined that she understood
the situation.  Perhaps it was because Mostyn saw
ruin staring him in the face that he had not ventured
to speak to her again of his love.  He had been
foolishly spendthrift: she had scolded him often
enough for his extravagance.  What if he was
making his last plunge&mdash;upon this Derby&mdash;and, if
successful, meant to claim her?
</p>

<p>
She was trembling with excitement.  She wanted
to know everything and that immediately.  "Go
on!" she cried petulantly.  "What will happen
if Pollux loses?"
</p>

<p>
"I'm a blundering fool," stammered Pierce.
"It's a secret, Miss Armitage."
</p>

<p>
"A secret I mean to share," she said decidedly.
Again she stamped her foot.  "Tell me!  I must
know everything&mdash;I must."
</p>

<p>
The explanation that might have followed here&mdash;for
Pierce saw no means of escape&mdash;was interrupted
by a general movement in the direction of the
coach.  The party was ready to start.  "You
must sit by me and tell me about it as we go down,"
Rada commanded.
</p>

<p>
There was a slight difficulty, in consequence of
this, when it came to allotting seats upon the
coach.  Rada stuck close to Pierce, in spite of all
the efforts of Lord Caldershot to intervene.  The
latter found himself at last, very much to his
chagrin, settled on the back seat in the company
of a simpering young lady not at all to his taste,
while on the other side he had the morose Captain
Armitage, who, as a matter of fact, hardly uttered
a word during the whole of the journey down.
</p>

<p>
Rada and Pierce were seated in front, and it
was not long before the girl had elicited from her
companion all that was to be told.  She learnt
the full story of Anthony Royce's will; learnt,
too, the true reason why Mostyn, loving and
desiring her as truly as ever, had been constrained
to silence.  Pierce, once having committed himself,
had been as straw in her hands; and perhaps,
since he saw that there was now every chance of
the misunderstanding between the pair of lovers
being cleared up, he was not, after all, so sorry
that he had spoken.
</p>

<p>
"If Pollux wins it's all right," he muttered to
himself, "and if Castor wins&mdash;well, I believe,
though poor Mostyn will be ruined, Rada will
want him to stick to her all the same.  And Mostyn
would never have thought of that.  Perhaps it's
just as well I spoke."  In this way he sought to
comfort himself for his indiscretion.
</p>

<p>
As for Rada, she was swayed by varying
emotions.  First and foremost came the knowledge
that Mostyn loved her, that he had never ceased
to love her.  "I've been such a little cat to him,"
she said, penitently clasping her hands together,
and quite careless now of revealing the truth of
her own love.  "But why didn't he tell me
everything?  Why should he have kept the secret
from me?  I'd have let him have Castor&mdash;I'd
have done anything&mdash;anything.  But it's only
now"&mdash;she drew her breath quickly&mdash;"when it's
too late, that I get to know the truth, and that
only by bullying it out of you, Mr. Trelawny!"  She
dashed her hand to her eyes.  "I feel that
it's I&mdash;I&mdash;who am standing in his way of gaining
all this money," she whispered, "and if Castor
wins now&mdash;oh, I shall hate myself!"
</p>

<p>
"It's just that that Mostyn feared," said Pierce
quickly.  "That's why he wouldn't tell you.
Castor had to run.  Miss Armitage, you must
just take it as a sporting chance.  Things must
be allowed to go on exactly as they are.  There
isn't a shade to choose between one horse or the
other.  Castor may win or Pollux may win; the
one means a lot to you, the other means a lot to
him.  It's fair for both sides: the issue rests upon a
race, a race where the chances are absolutely even.
One couldn't have anything better or finer than that."
</p>

<p>
But Rada turned her head away, and Pierce
could see by the quivering of her shoulders how
deeply moved she was.  It was a few moments
before he ventured to speak again.
</p>

<p>
"You love Mostyn, Miss Armitage?"  He
lowered his voice, even though his conversation
with the girl had passed quite unheeded, for she
was occupying the outside seat, while his neighbour
on the other side, a Parliamentary friend of Sir
Roderick's, an Irishman like himself, was deeply
engaged in discussing the question of cattle driving
with a lady of prominence in London society.
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps I do," the girl admitted, in a curiously
subdued tone of voice, "but I wouldn't own it,
even to myself, at first.  The more I knew it and
felt it, the more I was compelled to struggle against
it.  That's the sort of girl I am&mdash;a hateful, wayward
little creature altogether.  But I'm suffering
for it now, and I deserve to suffer."
</p>

<p>
She was crying very softly now, but it was a
relief to her to have opened her heart, and for
the rest of the way down she talked freely to Pierce,
telling him of the life she had led with her father,
the semi-savage life of so many years, giving him
an insight into her character such as she had never
allowed to any man.
</p>

<p>
They reached the course and took up their
position under the hill, the coach being greeted,
if anything, by more public interest than the year
before.  "Old Rory" himself was always an
object to attract attention, but, on the present
occasion, it was upon Rada that all eyes were fixed.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked so young, almost a child, and
yet it was quite three years since she had registered
her colours.  The lemon and lavender quartered
were already well known and recognised by most
race-goers.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick made his traditional little speech
very much in the same words as the year before,
save that he ended up by wishing good-luck to
Castor and to Pollux, and expressed a fervent
wish that both horses might win.  After that, as
was usual, the company dispersed to follow their
own pleasures.  Captain Armitage alone remained
stolidly seated in his place, and he shook his head
savagely when the butler, who knew him well
and was accustomed to administer to his fancies,
handed him up a brimming glass of champagne.
Champagne was strictly forbidden; Captain
Armitage was allowed a little weak whiskey and
water with his meals, and no more.  It was with
a curse muttered under his breath that he
informed the butler of the fact, and requested a
little plain soda-water instead.
</p>

<p>
Pierce stuck close to Rada that morning, though
on one occasion he nearly came to high words
with Lord Caldershot, who, as soon as the little
party had begun to disperse, waited at the foot of
the coach for Rada, eager that he should have
the honour of conducting her to the paddock.
</p>

<p>
"There's a horse belonging to a friend of mine
running in the first race, Miss Armitage," he
drawled, "and I want you to come and have a look
at it.  You can't do better than back Galahad
to win, and a shop.  I'll get the money on for
you, if you like," he added eagerly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you," replied Rada coldly, "but I'm
not going to back anything to-day.  I've got quite
enough interest in the one race.  Mr. Trelawny
has promised to walk with me to the paddock."
</p>

<p>
Lord Caldershot drew back, feeling unwarrantably
snubbed, and was perforce obliged to continue
his attentions to the gushing little damsel who had
been his companion on the way down, and whom
he regarded as altogether too inexperienced to
merit the time which he had wasted upon her.
</p>

<p>
For the nonce Rada seemed to have lost all her
reckless carelessness; she was quiet and subdued,
and she went about her work with all the calm
self-possession of a woman of the world.  She
interviewed her jockey and her trainer&mdash;old William
Treves himself&mdash;who had brought Castor to Epsom,
and who was prepared to stake his reputation
upon the ultimate success of his stable.  He would
turn up his nose defiantly at all mention of Pollux,
and the state of the betting did not influence him
in the least any more than did the unbeaten record
of Castor's adversary.  As the horses paraded
in the paddock, he would even point out to his
cronies certain fancied defects about Pollux which
were visible only to his imagination.
</p>

<p>
The absence of Mostyn Clithero, the owner of
the latter horse, caused some remark, but the
story of his accident had got abroad, and sympathy
with him was very generally expressed.  The
reason why "Old Rory" should have disposed of
his colt to that remarkably enthusiastic young
sportsman was a matter for far greater speculation,
and it was estimated that the sum paid by young
Clithero must have been enormous.
</p>

<p>
The most astonishing stories had got abroad
as to Mostyn's wealth and as to his desire to win
a big race.  His name was coupled with that of
Rada, and there were many who had evolved a
romance out of the rivalry of Castor and Pollux.
</p>

<p>
It was some time after lunch, and within an
hour of the big race, when Rada, who was strolling
in the enclosure with Pierce, suddenly stopped,
gave a low laugh, and laid her hand upon her
companion's arm, forcing him to stop.  "Look there!"
she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Pierce, following the direction of the girl's eyes,
perceived Jack Treves, conspicuous for his flowery
waistcoat, his tight-fitting trousers, the horsiness
of his coat, and the peculiar angle at which his
hat was tilted.  He was leaning against the lower
row of stalls in the Grand Stand, talking to a
remarkably smart-looking woman, who wore a feather of
exaggerated dimensions in her picture hat.  One
of her hands, ungloved&mdash;probably to show the
many rings she was wearing&mdash;rested in close
proximity to the big fingers of Jack Treves.  The
pair were laughing and talking, quite unconscious
of being watched.
</p>

<p>
"Who is it?" whispered Pierce.
</p>

<p>
"It's Daisy Simpson," returned Rada.  "Another
hated rival," she added, with a return of her natural
humour.  "She's an old flame of Jack's.  She
used to live down at Partinborough, and they were
great friends before, and after, he did me the
honour of wanting to marry me.  She went up
to town and became an actress, or something of
the sort.  She calls herself Daisy Montague and
she must be getting on remarkably well," Rada
continued ingenuously, "to be able to flaunt about
in such clothes as that; but I've always heard
that people make a lot of money at the music
halls."
</p>

<p>
Pierce glanced again quickly at the young
woman in question.  "Daisy Montague!" he
repeated.  "Ah, yes, I've heard of her."  He
smoothed his dark moustache with his hand, as if
to hide the smile that curved his lips.  "I've no
doubt she's very clever," he remarked; "a light
of the music halls.  I'm quite sure that her talent
has been appreciated."
</p>

<p>
"Jack doesn't look as if he was worrying about
me over much, does he?" asked Rada, with a little
laugh.  "I've often had an idea that he's rather
regretted being off with the old love.  I never
could understand why he preferred me.  Miss
Daisy is so much more his style.  Look at him
now.  Why, he's positively fawning over her!  They
used to say that he treated her rather badly in the
old days, but I suppose he admires her now she's
successful."
</p>

<p>
At that moment Jack turned and recognised
Rada.  He raised his hat, then after a few words
to Daisy, spoken in a quick undertone, he turned
away and sauntered up to the couple.
</p>

<p>
"I've been on the look-out for you all day,
Rada," he said jauntily.  "Must just have missed
you in the paddock an hour ago, but knew that
I should have to run across you soon."  He stared
pointedly at Pierce, who, however, refused to
take the hint.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you going to watch the race from?"
Jack enquired, after an awkward pause.
</p>

<p>
"I am going back to the coach," replied Rada,
carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I say, that's not fair!" exclaimed Jack.
"You promised to be with me to see the race,
Rada, you know you did."  He scowled offensively
upon Pierce.
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it," said Rada easily.  "I've
come down with the party and I've got to be with
them.  You looked quite happy without me,
Jack."  She cast a glance in the direction of the
stalls, where Daisy Simpson was now sunning
herself, smiling upon a tall, fair man, who had
just taken his place beside her.  "I've no doubt
that your friend over there will effectively fill my
place," she added meaningly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, you're jealous!" Jack exclaimed.  "I can
see that.  But Daisy Simpson's a jolly fine girl,
and I'm glad to have met her again."  He spoke
with intentional malice.  "Now look here, Rada,"
he went on, "if you can't be with me to see the
race I want a word with you here.  I'll take you
back to the coach afterwards.  We'll have this
matter out once and for all, see?"
</p>

<p>
"Very well."  Rada turned to Pierce, who had
been standing a little apart.  "Will you excuse
me for a few minutes, Mr. Trelawny?" she said.
"If you'll go back to the coach I'll join you there
very soon."
</p>

<p>
Pierce nodded, and Rada and Jack moved away
together.
</p>

<p>
"Now I want to have a definite understanding
with you, Miss Rada," Jack said roughly, after
they had taken a few steps.  "Do you mean to
marry me, or don't you?  I'm not the sort of
man to be kept dangling for long at the end of
a piece of string.  If you want to cry off, say so.
Clear up the money you and your father owe me
and have done with it."  He cast a furtive glance
from under his heavy brows in the direction of
Daisy Simpson.  "I don't believe you care a hang
for me, really," he went on, "while Daisy&mdash;well,
I've just been having a chat with her and she's
as fond of me now as ever she was.  London's
made a different woman of her too, as you can
see for yourself.  She's the kind of girl any chap
might be proud of."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt you're quite right, Jack," said Rada.
"I can quite understand Miss Simpson's attraction
for you."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm talking straight to you, aren't
I?  If you want to give me the chuck, just say
so.  Though, mind you," he repeated threateningly,
"I shall expect payment in full.  That's plain
enough, what?"
</p>

<p>
"It's very plain, Jack," replied Rada quietly,
"and really I think I had better pay you the
money.  If Castor wins I can do so quite easily."  A
shade of anxiety crossed her brow as she spoke.
If Castor won!  Yes, it was upon that that she
had been depending to escape from this foolish
tangle in which she had involved herself.  If
Castor won she could pay Jack what she owed him,
and be free.  But then, on the other hand, if Castor
won, what would be the consequence to Mostyn
Clithero?
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Castor will win right enough."  Jack
tugged at his scrappy moustache and smiled
maliciously.  "You can take that as a tip from
me, Rada, though it's your own horse we're talking
about.  Castor's going to win, my word upon it."  He
chuckled under his breath.  "I've seen to
that," he added.
</p>

<p>
Rada drew up abruptly, staring at her
companion.  "What did you say?" she asked
quickly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing," responded Jack a trifle uneasily.
"Only I've backed Castor pretty heavily myself.
That's all I meant."
</p>

<p>
Rada was only half reassured, but she could
elicit nothing more, though she questioned Jack
closely.  The latter was inclined to be rough,
threatening, and impertinent.  From his point of
view he had been treated badly, and it made no
difference that he himself was willing to cry off
the engagement.  He pointed out to Rada&mdash;a fact
of which she was already aware&mdash;that her father's
affairs were so involved that, even if Castor won,
she would hardly be able to put them straight.
It was not only to the Treves's that they were in
debt; Captain Armitage had consistently raised
money in any way that suggested itself, and now
he was about to reap the harvest of his follies.
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you know your own affairs best,"
grumbled Jack, "but it's a fool's game to give
me the chuck, I can tell you that.  I suppose
you're lookin' to Clithero&mdash;damn him!&mdash;to pull
you through, but you're backin' a wrong 'un there,
Rada.  He'll come a smasher when Pollux fails
to-day.  No man can stand the pace at which
he's been goin'; it's not in reason."
</p>

<p>
"Will you please take me back to the coach?"
Rada spoke imperiously.  "I have promised to
be with Sir Roderick and Mr. Trelawny for the
race.  They will look after me then and afterwards."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, there was little time to spare.  The bell
was ringing; people were scurrying across the
course.  Rada and Jack had barely reached the
other side when a low cry went up from the crowd
and a black horse emerged from the paddock,
a horse which was proclaimed by the puce and
black of the jockey to be Mostyn Clithero's Pollux.
</p>

<p>
It was at that moment, as they stood watching
for Castor to appear, that a rough-looking fellow
pushed his way to Jack's side, thrust a note into
his hand, and then remarking, "I've had a hunt
for you, guv'nor," edged away again.
</p>

<p>
"What's that letter about?" Rada put the
question as Jack read the communication.  All
her suspicions had returned to her.  She felt
possessed of a curious clairvoyant power, and knew
that she had reason to be on her guard.
</p>

<p>
"It's nothing to do with you."  Jack crushed
the note in his hand, preparatory to thrusting it
in his pocket.
</p>

<p>
With a sudden sharp movement, totally
unexpected, Rada seized the paper.  She hardly
knew why she did so; she was impelled by the
action of some unaccountable power.
</p>

<p>
"Give that to me.  Curse you, what d'you mean
by it?"  Jack sought vainly to rescue his property,
but since he could not exercise actual violence
there under the Epsom Hill, he was powerless.
Rada unfolded the crumpled paper and read the
missive.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right, Jack.  I've got Ben to do the
job.  Only found him this morning.  It's all up
with Pollux.  We've wiped off our little debt, and
you can turn your brass upon Castor.  Meet you
after the race&mdash;you know where."  The note was
signed "Ted."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Rada stood still, then she found
tongue.  "You blackguard!"  But her breath was
coming in deep gasps, and she could say no more.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Rada," growled the man, "you've
no right to read my letter.  But let that pass.
Since it's all for your good you won't be such
a fool as to kick up a shindy.  Your horse will
win the Derby, and that's what you want.  Give
me that paper, and say no more about it."
</p>

<p>
"No!" Rada crushed the incriminating document
in her hand.  "I won't!"
</p>

<p>
He seized her arm.  "Give it to me," he hissed.
"Rada, if you make a fool of yourself, I swear
before God that you shall suffer for it.  I can ruin
you and your father, and I'll do it."
</p>

<p>
"Let me go!"  The girl struggled free.  They
were surrounded by a crowd, and the man was
helpless.  "If you dare to try and hold me, I'll
strike you.  Yes, here before everyone&mdash;I'll strike
you with my fist in the face."
</p>

<p>
Jack swore under his breath.  He hurled vile
oaths at the girl, but he was powerless.  As a cheer
from the crowd proclaimed that Castor was galloping
down the course, Rada, his owner, darting in
and out wildly and ingloriously among vehicles of
all kinds, sought the coach.
</p>

<p>
She failed to find it, but she ran into the arms
of Pierce Trelawny, which was more to the point.
</p>

<p>
"Miss Armitage&mdash;-why, what is the matter?"
</p>

<p>
"I want you to come with me, Mr. Trelawny."  She
was gasping for breath.  "You must come at
once.  I must see the stewards.  There isn't a
moment to be lost."
</p>

<p>
It was very evident, from the girl's demeanour,
that the matter was one of vital importance.  Pierce
asked no useless questions, but placed himself
unreservedly at Rada's disposition.  He contrived
to steer her, though not without difficulty, to the
other side, and directed their course to the Grand
Stand.
</p>

<p>
"There's going to be foul play," Rada panted as
they walked.  "Pollux is to be got at&mdash;I don't
know how."
</p>

<p>
"And you will warn the stewards?"
</p>

<p>
She made no direct reply, but muttered something
under her breath.  Pierce could not quite
distinguish the words, but he thought he heard:
"Castor will win&mdash;Castor is bound to win."
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Upon the coach they wondered what had become
of Rada, but assumed that she was with Pierce
Trelawny, watching the race from the other side.
She would want to be upon the spot to lead her
horse in&mdash;if Castor should prove victorious.
</p>

<p>
The start was delayed longer than usual, owing
to the vagaries of a bad-tempered colt.  Sir
Roderick, gazing through his field-glasses, stamped
his feet with excitement.
</p>

<p>
"They're off!" he shouted at last, and for the
rest of the race he kept up a running commentary
of the principal events.
</p>

<p>
"Bad-tempered beast that&mdash;Prince Eugene&mdash;wasn't
it?  He's no good&mdash;not a bit of good.
Won't be in it.  Being left behind already, unless
I'm mistaken.  The rest are coming along nicely.
Can't make out either of the favourites,
though&mdash;they're too far off as yet.  Who's that forging
ahead?  Green sleeves, and yellow, I fancy.  It
must be Candahar.  He won't keep up that pace
for long.  Going well, though.  Ah, here comes
another&mdash;level with him now!  Goliath, by Jove!
Where the deuce are the favourites?"
</p>

<p>
He swept the field with his glasses, and
presently gave vent to a shout.  "Come along,
Pollux!"  He glanced down in sudden trepidation.
"Oh, it's all right!  Miss Armitage
isn't there.  I may cheer my own horse.  Come
along, Pollux!"
</p>

<p>
Castor and Pollux were running practically level.
Some four or five horses were in advance of them,
and about the same number followed behind.
Between these, the two big black colts, suddenly
revealed by the dividing up of the field, stood out
conspicuously.  The lemon and lavender&mdash;the puce
and black diamonds&mdash;the two horses that might
have been twins&mdash;Castor and Pollux&mdash;battling
together for Rada and for Mostyn&mdash;shoulder to
shoulder, like brethren, yet, in very truth, the
sternest of adversaries.
</p>

<p>
On they came, running easily, each palpably
being held in by his rider, reserving force till it
should be needed.  The rest of the field was
straggling by now.  Two or three, including Prince
Eugene and Candahar, had already dropped far
behind, "stony," and quite out of the running.
Pendragon was leading and looked like making
a brave fight.
</p>

<p>
One by one the horses that were in advance
of the favourites were overtaken, passed, and
left behind.  The crowd roared its delight
at each succeeding achievement, for Castor
and Pollux, once they elected to take the
foremost place, would certainly not again drop
behind.  And still they came neck to neck and
shoulder to shoulder.
</p>

<p>
Near Tattenham Corner, Pendragon still held the
lead.  The tussle was short and sharp.  Castor and
Pollux made a simultaneous spurt, and forged to
the front amid the uproarious cheers of the vast,
heaving mass of humanity that crowded Epsom
Downs.  It was a struggle now between the favourites,
for there was none to challenge their advantage.
But what a struggle! what a contest! what
a race!
</p>

<p>
At Tattenham Corner, Pollux was leading
by a little&mdash;very gradually, and without any
display of premature energy, he was forcing
the running.  "Come along, Pollux!" yelled
Sir Roderick, waving his arms, and perspiring
with eagerness.  "Brave horse! the race is
yours!"  He lowered his voice and muttered:
"God send you first to the post!"  The words
were breathed like a prayer, and there was no
irreverence in them.  Sir Roderick knew all
that the victory of Pollux meant to
Mostyn&mdash;and to Rada.
</p>

<p>
"Hullo! what's up?"  The cheers of the crowd
changed to a yell of dismay.  Those who were at
the back and could see but ill, put the question
frantically to the more fortunate ones in front.
"A horse down?  Which is it?  Pollux?  Good
God!"
</p>

<p>
The name of Pollux swept from lip to lip.  At
the moment of rounding the Corner, Pollux had
been seen to sway, to stumble&mdash;then, carried on
by his own velocity, to go down head first.  Castor
swept by, unchallenged now, a clear course to
victory before him.
</p>

<p>
Sir Roderick struck his fists violently together.
"The devil's in it!" he roared.  "Yes, the devil
himself!"  He dashed his hand over his eyes,
which had suddenly grown dim.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Mostyn!"  The words came from his heart.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
MOSTYN COMPLETES HIS TASK.
</h3>

<p>
"Three o'clock!  The race should be starting in
a few moments now, Clithero."  David Isaacson
bustled into the room where Mostyn lay upon an
improvised bed.  Isaacson had not gone to the
Derby.  An important piece of business had detained
him in London, and when that was concluded he
had devoted his time to his young friend.
</p>

<p>
Mostyn had been moved very tenderly and with
the utmost care from the bed-chamber, which had at
first been allotted him, to a room where Isaacson,
some months before, had set up a tape machine.
In this way, Mostyn would learn the result of the
race with no delay at all.
</p>

<p>
His injury was a simple fracture of the upper
arm, and when the bone had been well set by a
skilful surgeon, called in at once, Mostyn had found
himself fairly comfortable, though, of course, it was
necessary for him to remain absolutely at rest.
A message had been sent to his father, a letter
written for Mostyn by Isaacson, with which the
bill was enclosed, and John Clithero had come round
at once, even to the house of the much-hated David
Isaacson, and there, by Mostyn's bedside, the
reconciliation between father and son had been
complete.
</p>

<p>
"I have fallen low, Mostyn," the old man had
muttered, "and it is I who have to crave your
forgiveness."
</p>

<p>
He would have said much more, but Mostyn
would not allow him to do so, and presently, Cicely
coming in, John Clithero was able to realise that,
though he had lost two of his sons, he had at least
regained the son and daughter whom he had so
ruthlessly turned from his door.  These two had
stood by him in his hour of need.
</p>

<p>
"I have learnt my lesson," he sighed.  "And it
is you, Mostyn, and you, Cicely, who have taught
it to me."
</p>

<p>
Upon the following day&mdash;Derby Day&mdash;he was,
perhaps, as keenly excited as anyone else in the
result of the race, for he knew now all that depended
upon it.  He superintended the carrying down of
his son to the room where they could watch the
tape, and he would hardly consent to leave Mostyn's
side even for his meals.  When Isaacson arrived to
announce the hour, it was as much as he could do
to sit still.
</p>

<p>
He was sadly changed&mdash;there was no doubt as
to that.  All his arrogance had fallen from him,
to give place to a kind of apologetic demeanour;
it was as though he was asking pardon from one
and all for the mistakes of his life, mistakes which
must have been borne in on him by much solitary
reflection, by a very agony of self-examination.
He had been his own judge, and he was as hard
in the verdict pronounced against himself as he
had ever been against one whom, in his pharisaical
self-righteousness, he had condemned as a sinner.
All that John Clithero had endured was plainly
writ on his face.  He was a broken-down man&mdash;one
who had lost faith in himself.  Even David Isaacson
had felt sorry for him and had treated him with
rough kindness&mdash;for Mostyn's sake.
</p>

<p>
Three o'clock.  How slowly the minutes passed!
Mostyn lay, propped up by his pillows, his free
hand clasped in that of Cicely, and he was trying
to talk of all possible subjects except that which
was uppermost in his mind.  Isaacson sat by the
tape machine, and John Clithero kept hovering
backwards and forwards, his agitation painfully
apparent.
</p>

<p>
In his mind, Mostyn could see all that was
happening.  The horses had left the paddock by now
and had galloped down to the starting-post.  How
the crowd must have cheered first Castor and then
Pollux!&mdash;or, perhaps, it was the other way about.
He wondered if Rada was watching the race from the
coach; he thought she probably would be, for Sir
Roderick and Pierce would take care of her, and,
if Castor won, she would, of course, wait to lead
her horse in.
</p>

<p>
He drew a deep sigh as he thought of Rada.
How would she behave when she learnt the truth?
If Castor won, would he even have the courage to
tell her why he had thrown himself into such direct
competition with her?  Would he not be afraid to
do so because of the trouble which such knowledge
must necessarily bring to her?  She would be
horrified to learn that her success meant his ruin.
Mostyn was inclined to think that he must leave
her in ignorance, even at the expense of never
gaining her forgiveness.
</p>

<p>
The horses must have started by now.  As he
lay there, he could almost hear the shouting of the
crowd, that sound so familiar to him, so musical in
his ears.  The noises in the square without blended
and harmonised with his fancy.  A boy was
whistling, further away an organ was playing&mdash;then
there came a sudden hush&mdash;yes, the horses must
be running!  He wondered if they had got away
at once; somehow he had a strong impression of a
false start.
</p>

<p>
The tape clicked out the information.  It kept
up a monotonous tick-tick that was jarring to the
nerves.  "Off 3.15.  Delay at start!"  Then
followed a list of the starters and jockeys&mdash;a long
list&mdash;there were fully a dozen in all.  Isaacson held
out the tape, and read them off one by one.
</p>

<p>
Then came a pause.  It was a clock on the mantel-piece,
an elaborate affair of antique French china,
that was ticking now.  Mostyn had hardly noticed
it before, but it was extraordinary that he should
not have done so.  Why, the sound was so loud
and aggressive that it seemed to be beating directly
against the drums of his ears.  He pressed his left
hand upon his ear, but it made no difference.  The
noise went on just the same&mdash;if anything augmented
in strength.  How fast his heart was beating,
too&mdash;perhaps that had something to do with it.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, here we are!"  A cry from Isaacson, as
the machine recommenced its ticking.  He almost
dragged upon the tape.  The Jew was as excited
as anyone else in the room&mdash;of them all, Mostyn
was the calmest.  "Now we'll see.  Pollux for
ever!  I don't mind betting&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He broke off, the tape hanging in his hand.
His jaw fell.  Mostyn noticed at that moment
that his scarf-pin, a huge diamond, had nearly
worked its way out of his tie.  It looked as if it
must scratch his chin.
</p>

<p>
"Well, let's have it.  Is the result out?"  Mostyn
put the question calmly, but he knew
already that Pollux had lost.
</p>

<p>
"Clithero, my boy, I'm sorry&mdash;I'm damned
sorry!"  Isaacson stood up, his eyes still fixed
upon the tape that was now hanging in coils, like
a snake, about his fingers.  The ticking went on
cruelly, remorselessly; it was like the needles of
the weird sisters spinning out the fate of man.
</p>

<p>
"Let's hear it!"
</p>

<p>
"Castor first, Pendragon second, Goliath third."  The
Jew's voice sounded very far away as he spoke
the words.
</p>

<p>
"And Pollux?"
</p>

<p>
"Blessed if I can make it out!  Paragon was
fourth.  And here are the names of the others."  He
tore the offending tape into shreds.  "Ah"&mdash;the
machine was ticking again.  "What's this?
Pollux, one of the favourites, fell at Tattenham
Corner when leading.  Horse and jockey
uninjured."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn broke into a laugh.  "So that's the end
of it," he exclaimed.  "Something was bound to
happen to any horse that ran in my colours.  Well,
the tension's over, anyway."  He fell back upon
his pillows.  He was quite calm; something seemed
to have snapped, and with it had come infinite
relief.  There would be no more harassing of his
nerves, no more blood on the boil.  It was over
and he had lost.  At any rate he could rest.
</p>

<p>
His father was leaning over him, pressing his
hand.  "It's all right, Mostyn," the old
man was urging in a voice thick with emotion.
"You've lost a big fortune, but what does it
matter?  You will come back to me&mdash;my son:
I've only got one son now&mdash;you, whom I drove
from my door."
</p>

<p>
Mostyn pressed the hand in return.  On the
other side of him Cicely was whispering words of
comfort, words such as only a woman can find.
"It will be all right with Rada, too, Mostyn.  I'm
as sure of that as of my life.  She will be so happy
at winning that she will forget everything else.
And you're not a pauper now, remember that,
since you're friends with father again.  You can
just go to Rada and ask her to be your wife: she'll
say 'yes,' or I know nothing of my sex."
</p>

<p>
Isaacson, too, was voluble in sympathy.  "It's
not your fault that you've come down, Clithero,
my boy.  You did your best, and no man can do
more.  I admire you for your pluck, and every
sportsman will admire you as much as I do when
the truth is known."
</p>

<p>
The starting prices were ticked out unheeded
while Mostyn's friends stood about his bed; the
tape was falling in long coils upon the floor.
Outside, in the square, a newsboy could be
heard shouting "Winner!" at the top of his
voice.  The momentous news had been given
to London.
</p>

<p>
Isaacson stepped back to the machine and began
once more to run the tape through his fingers,
reading out the starting prices as cheerily as he
could, as well as any other information that had
come to hand.  Suddenly he was silent; he held
a long strip before him, lifted close to his
eyes&mdash;for he was a trifle short-sighted&mdash;and he was
apparently reading the writing upon it over and
over again.  During these moments his face
expressed the most remarkable changes of emotion.
He had begun to read carelessly, then his attention
had been concentrated; finally, with a great wrench,
he tore off the strip, waved it in the air, and gave
vent to an undignified and apparently
inappropriate shout.
</p>

<p>
"God of my fathers!" he cried, literally dancing
across the floor, "but who would have thought
it?  Why, the girl's a champion, a heroine"&mdash;he
could not find words to express his feelings&mdash;"a
brick!"
</p>

<p>
"What are you driving at?"  Mostyn dragged
himself up again.  For a moment he wondered if
Isaacson had taken leave of his senses.
</p>

<p>
"It's all right!  That's what I'm driving at.
Read for yourself; read!"  He held out the strip
of paper before Mostyn's eyes.  The latter took
it in his left hand, but presently let it fall.  The
letters all seemed to run into each other, and the
print was blurred.
</p>

<p>
"What does it mean?" he gasped.
</p>

<p>
"It means that at the very last minute Miss
Armitage appears to have transferred Castor from
herself to you.  The whole thing is very vague at
present, for Castor certainly ran in her colours.
But, from this, she seems to be no longer the owner
of the horse.  Castor is yours, Mostyn, and won
the Derby for you!"
</p>

<p>
Mostyn lifted his hand to his head.  "It isn't
possible," he muttered.  "There must be some
mistake.  It couldn't have been done."
</p>

<p>
"It's right, you mark my words!" cried Isaacson,
whose exultation had by no means passed
away.  "It will be explained before long.  And
you owe it all to Miss Armitage, my boy!  She
must have found out why you wanted so
badly to win.  There's a noble girl for you!
I tell you what it is, Clithero: it's your duty
to fall in love with her and marry her&mdash;yes, by
Jove, it is!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah, if I could!"  Mostyn sighed in answer.
Nevertheless he continued to express his
disbelief, though the tape message was read to
him over and over again, and though it
was confirmed by a later, but still rather vague,
announcement.
</p>

<p>
It was not till about a couple of hours later
that everything was cleared up by the arrival
of Rada herself, who, in the company of
Pierce, had motored up to London from Epsom.
Sir Roderick would have liked to have accompanied
them, but he had his coach and his guests
to attend to.
</p>

<p>
After the first excited greetings, Pierce told the
story, while Rada stood bashfully aside&mdash;yes,
perhaps for the first time in her life she showed
symptoms of shyness.
</p>

<p>
"That scoundrel Jack Treves appears to have
arranged with Ted Wilson, the jockey&mdash;both
enemies of yours, Mostyn&mdash;to play a dirty trick
upon Pollux.  They got Benjamin Harris to do it.
Ben Harris was one of old Treves's stablemen once,
and I expect it was he who doctored Silver Star
at Jack's orders, but that's by the way.  I'm
glad to say he was caught by the police, and
he's given the whole plot away.  Jack and
Wilson will catch it hot, and serve them right,
too!  What the scoundrel did was to hide, as he
thought, behind a tree, and shoot at Pollux
with an air-gun, or a catapult or something of
the sort.  No wonder the poor beast swerved
and fell.  Pollux was leading at the time and was
going to win."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure of that," put in Rada, in spite
of her shyness.
</p>

<p>
"Well, never mind.  What is really of importance
is that Miss Armitage, just before the race,
surprised a note written to Jack by Wilson, which
gave the whole game away.  And, as it happened,
Miss Armitage knew just how you were situated,
Mostyn.  It was my fault, for I let it all out,
and I'm glad I did."  He stared defiantly
at his friend, and laughed.  "Don't scold
me now, however&mdash;you can do all that when
I've finished my yarn.  Well, as long as things
were straight and above board Miss Armitage
would have let matters take their course&mdash;you
stood a good sporting chance to win.  But when
she found out the plot she came to me&mdash;the
race was just about to start&mdash;and made
me take her to the stewards.  I didn't know what
she meant to do till we were in the presence of
those august individuals.  Then she announced
that she wanted to make Castor over to you.
Of course, there were all sorts of difficulties
in the way, but Miss Armitage got over
them all.  I think she must have fascinated the
gentlemen.  Of course I don't know what they
thought"&mdash;he glanced slyly at Rada, who turned
away blushing.
</p>

<p>
"Anyway," Pierce went on, "the stewards are
omnipotent, you know.  So a transfer was signed
and attested, countersigned by the stewards, and
a wire was sent to Weatherby's.  It was all
in order, I can assure you, and quite legal.
Of course, it was too late to make any
immediate announcement, so the race had to go
on as it was, Castor being ridden in Miss
Armitage's colours.  But Castor is your horse,
Mostyn; no one can dispute that, nor your right
to Anthony Royce's millions.  I congratulate
you a thousand times.  There, now I've told you
everything."
</p>

<p>
It was when Pierce ceased speaking, and as
Mostyn, his eyes fixed upon Rada, could find no
words to reply, that John Clithero stepped across
the room and took the girl's hand in his.
</p>

<p>
"Bless you for what you have done," he said.
"My son has spoken to me of you to-day, Miss
Armitage&mdash;your name has been constantly on his
lips.  He is afraid that he has offended you; but
I don't think that he can have done so, or you
would not have sacrificed yourself for his sake.
But I am sure that he would like to hear you say
he is forgiven, and that he will want to thank
you&mdash;alone."
</p>

<p>
He led the girl to Mostyn's bedside, then,
followed by all the rest of the party, stole out
of the room.
</p>

<p class="thought">
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
"Do you remember," Mostyn whispered, some
time later, in Rada's ear, when all had been
explained between them and every difficulty smoothed
away, "do you remember, my darling, the terms
of our wonderful wager upon the coach last Derby
Day?"
</p>

<p>
Rada needed no reflection.  "I said I would
wager my life that you would never win a Derby,"
she murmured, "and I have lost."
</p>

<p>
"You staked your life, and I have won it,"
he replied.  "That is a finer thing than money.
I am happy, Rada&mdash;so very happy!  In a
single day I have won a big race&mdash;a huge
fortune&mdash;and, best of all, your life&mdash;the life of
the girl I love."
</p>

<p>
His sound arm was resting on her shoulder.
He drew her face to his, and kissed her on the lips,
and this time she did not repel him.
</p>

<p>
"Do you really love such a little vixen, such
a little devil, as I?" she asked wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
"You're a 'hangel,'" he answered, laughingly
recalling the words of Samuel Willis.  "I always
knew it, and to-day you've proved it.  Kiss me
again, Rada, and then we'll summon the others
and tell them the news."
</p>

<p>
Smiling softly, she bent and obeyed.  "This is
better than winning a Derby!" she sighed
happily.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
